Right after graduation, I started to work in the field of education and found helping students improve their learning skills is very gratifying, especially those who are struggling with learning or having less motivation to learn. Initially, I wasn't sure whether I should be working in the education because I honestly had no idea what I wanted to do for my future. However, I slowly got interested in the education while trying different teaching methods as I realized that learning is no longer just about test scores. ","At first, test scores were all I was concerned about because the evaluation of teachers' performance was majorly based on their students' test results. That gave tremendous pressure and stopped me from enjoying my teaching. Later on, I decided to try shift my focus from scores to learning or fun learning, I realized I didn't just help students improve scores but more importantly, their conception of learning slowly changed. Learning could happen anywhere, anytime, with anyone. It's never limited to classrooms, certain time periods or just with teachers and fellow students. ","I met this lady around 45 few years back in Beijing. She was learning English from ABCs in order to pass some English exams in order to study in the US as a visiting scholar. She intended to achieve this goal because her daughter was studying in the high school in the US. She wanted to improve her English to stay with her daughter. Despite many difficulties, her determination and hard work truly struck me. I learned from her that learning is never limited to young people. You learn as you grow. ","When I see my students focus more on learning rather than achieving a high test score, I feel gratified because teaching people to love learning is what all education practitioners want to accomplish. When people start to love learning, they will be more motivated to search for knowledge with or without guidance. ","The time and energy you have to devote to each individual, and you will not the outcome of your work immediately. ","It's hard. I'm still battling them. One way I think is to look up to some role models around you. To see how they have combat these hurdles, and surround yourself with people who have aspiration and commitment to accomplishing their goals and learn from them. ",Corporation,,,,,,,,,,Educational media or technology design/development/production,,,Moderately valuable,Moderately valuable,Extremely valuable,Quite valuable,Moderately valuable,Moderately valuable,Quite valuable,Slightly valuable,Slightly valuable,Quite valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,,,Extremely valuable,Moderately difficult,"Self-reflection on one's learning and teaching experience is pivotal but somehow has been forgotten by many people. That's the main motivation for me to answer those valuable questions which allow me to think about my personal experience. ",Quite well,"I seldom think about my initial reason to get into the educational field, such as is it my choice or because of the reality to make a living? What has made me persist in this field? However, questions like ""What can I do after graduating from HGSE?"" allow me to rethink my goal as an educator. I think some of these questions are hard to answer because they force you to be honest to yourself and relate your present situation to your grand dream. ","Working in a corporation is what I am pursuing after HGSE; however, high-education is also my pursuit because tertiary educational system is something that I am not so familiar with but I assume I ""know"" a lot. I think many people like me may have some misconceptions about higher education, which I hope to correct and rectify. ","When asking about individuals' motivation to get into the field of education, providing a list of options and how important they are could also be useful in addition to the subjective question. The list could be: personal goal (change the world), help students to learn; stable job; reputation of educators in your country; income, etc. Education nowadays has become a lucrative business in many countries. People who get into these educational corporations intend to make more profits or achieve a higher salary. Education is more like a business now, serving the relatively privileged few. ","When I was in the college, I came across a book written by Dr. Carol Dweck called Mindset. This book has powerfully changed the way I think about humans' learning abilities. I used to believe that if people didn't foster a good learning habit during the prime years of learning, supposedly from primary school to high school, they will never be able to learn efficiently again. However, Dr. Dweck has convinced me in her book that as long as individuals have a growth mindset, believing  that they can continue learning better, they will still advance and develop despite their age. 

I was enchanted by the title of the book on that day because I was often called as a slow learner and what's worse, I believed in it because I often failed at the exams. At that time I desperately needed this book to transform myself and change my mindset about learning abilities. I have read this book a couple of times, and I could say it was and still is the best book I have ever owned. ","Well, I wanted to improve my learning abilities and be confident about myself. I didn't want to have a fixed and negative belief of myself, thinking I was dumb, stupid or a loser. Even I had failed many times before during my school years, even I did miss the best time to learn as a child, even I though I just hated learning, I did somehow believe that conception of myself was wrong and not grounded. I thought changing myself started from changing my beliefs and ideas about myself, so I picked up that book. ",,"First, a relaxed, friendly and encouraging learning environment where students feel comfortable to speak up and share their ideas without being judged by anyone is super crucial. Once students sense there is a ""right-or-wrong"" judgment of their answer, they start to cringe and their minds just narrow down. 

Second, a systematic learning plan and efficient methodology is also pivotal. Without a system, one may simply get lost in the middle of learning and feel meaningless; as a result, one tends to quit easily. 

Third, timely and effective feedback of one's learning is powerful. Individuals learn faster and longer when they are provided with feedback from peers, tutors or mentors as they know how they can improve and where they get wrong. We can't just expect people to find out their weaknesses by themselves. Everyone has a blind point they don't see.

I also realized that so many people have struggled with all types of hurdles in their life and they managed to overcome these challenges, which gave me tremendous courage. ","Learning takes time, determination, concentration and feedback. Great people in various areas have accomplished success due to many factors. ","I used to think that a good study/learning habit is the only key element that determines one's success in learning; however, this book told me that how we think about ourselves is as crucial as that. ",Slightly difficult,"When comparing how this learning experience representative or different from what I thought about learning, I did think for quite a while as comparison and contrast require certain degree of critical thinking. However, relating to one's learning experience is not that difficult because this book has impacted my life since then. I can easily tell what learning experience is meaningful to me once I read the question. ",Moderately well,"All these years, I have been telling people about this book and what I've learned from it, and I even recommended this book to my friends. I kept reflecting on myself and my learning style, so this section helps me to reflect more on myself and about effective learning. ","Well, I think besides reading Dr. Dweck's book Mindset. I also love working with people with a growth mind and those who are not judgmental, open-minded and curious. Teamwork and projects could be stimulating and spur one to discover about areas he or she has neglected or is ignorant about. ","I am a little confounded by the definition of ""learning preferences"". I thought maybe it was about whether one is a visual or audio learner, or if one prefers to work alone or in a group project. So ""learning preference "" could be clarified better or a list of learning styles could be provided to respondents. ",Quite accurate,"When we get older and gain more life and working experience, we slowly learn to do soul-searching and frequently reflect on ourselves. Personally, the older I grow, the more I think about my personalized and effective way of learning instead of listening to teachers or instructors. ",,,Slightly accurate,,,"I used to think that genes are the predominant factor of one's learning ability; however, as I have observed from the past 4 years of working, I noticed a person's family upbringing plays a vital role in one's achievement. The impacts of one's parents (in most cases) are arguably the most important determinant. Besides, one's social environment is influential too. These factors could indirectly or directly change one's perception, beliefs and drive of learning. ",Not at all accurate,,,"I think I have elaborated in the previous section. The book written by Dr. Dweck called Mindset has scientifically proved that intelligence CAN be enhanced over time through effective and persistent training, timely feedback and personal reflection on one's learning, whether a skill or a course. Besides, Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, made a talk on TED regarding learning improvement. With his intriguing video course, students who failed at Algebra improved in the course gradually. Genes are an important factor but it's not a determinant, and definitely can be enhanced. ",Slightly accurate,,,"We always think talents are born not made, but if we look into the lives of those greats in different areas in history: Beethoven, Mozart, Michelangelo, etc. all spent an enormous amount of time on composing music, painting or sculpturing. With the rigorous training from his father since young, Mozart was in contact with music almost all day long. In the book by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool called Peaks: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, they showed that with effective training, normal five-year old could also have identify high-pitch sound just like Mozart did. Many more experiments in the book demonstrated that talents CAN be cultivated. ",Extremely accurate,"One of the key objective in education is to teach people how to learn well not just what to learn. The ""how"" includes exploring one's learning style, features, strengths and weakness, ways to search information and the likes. ",,,,,"I am bit confused by the word ""learners"". Is a five-year-old regarded a learner? If so, how can he be responsible for his learning; instead, his parents or school teachers should be responsible. If the ""learner"" refers to a school child or a teenager, many factors are responsible: government policy, schools, teachers, peers and of course parents. What about ""adults""? I think too much pressure is put on a single person to say that he or she is ""ultimately"" responsible for the learning because the experience and people one encounters all play a role in his learning process. Some factors are equally crucial. That's the reason I chose ""Not sure"". ",,Slightly accurate,,,"Without efforts, even the most talented person may not accomplish success as all work demands some endeavor, motivation and commitment. Unfortunately, we can see from people around us, many are very hard-working yet remain mediocre. The core is not only the efforts they put, but more importantly but also the fact that whether they receive effective guidance and timely feedback from highly-skilled instructor. From the Indian movie Dangal, we see that world-class players all have prominent coaches to have stellar achievement. Therefore, efforts constitute a portion of their success, not the determinant. ",Moderately accurate,,,"Internal vs External rewards. Which is better? I am still skeptical about the strict dividing line between these two types of rewards. Internal reward could be incited by the external gain. For example, a banker is motivated to do his job because of his passion in the financial market. That's internal reward. It could also be the high payment he could get from being a banker. Overtime, that external reward is transformed into internal reward. He become more interested into the field not only due to the payment, but also due to his experience, expertise and connection he has built. ",Slightly accurate,,,"It depends on what type of learners they are. If individuals are reflective learners, they will constantly look at the way they are learning and how they have changed over time, but if individuals do have form the habit of self-reflection, it's hard to say they can judge their learning accurately. ",Slightly accurate,,,"It depends on what subject an individual is learning. For scientific concepts, I think it is crucial for learners to know about facts, information and data. But for humanity studies, deep thinking can also derive from real-life experience. For instance, by helping low-achieving students, a teacher will try various teaching method and maybe end up knowing better about what ""blended learning"" or ""personalized learning"" means than a teacher who simply read those facts and definition about those concepts. ",Quite accurate,"Stress and anxiety aren’t always bad, and sometimes could motivate learners to dig up their potentials. Challenges and competitions could bring stress to us but could also stimulate us to perform better and persist longer in face of difficulties and hurdles. By getting to know others’ strengths and by comparing ourselves to others, we learn that there is still tremendous space for us to improve. 
",,,Quite accurate,"That is one goal, but more precisely, I would say ""helping people to learn how to learn"" is my ultimate goal in education. I want to teach people including myself to understand themselves better and find effective ways and tools to assist their learning in life and in career, soft skills and hard knowledge. ",,,Slightly accurate,,,"Many of us have a preferred learning style, some visual learners and others are auditory or kinesthetic; however, it doesn’t mean we can ONLY learn in this approach. It just means that we can learn BETTER or more EFFICIENTLY when learning as we prefer. Learners become more motivated to continue learning and combat difficulties in face of challenges. In fact, all learning styles contribute to our mastery of knowledge. Take myself for example, I like to move to think. When I am interacting with people or doing projects or just engage in physical activities, I am super motivated to learn. However, I can sit for long time and just keep reading. I am more a hands-on learner. Therefore, teaching should involve many learning styles, helping students explore and develop themselves not just match as matching could limit students’ potential too. 
 
",Quite accurate,,,,Extremely accurate,,,,Quite accurate,,,,Not at all accurate,,,"Positive encouragement is essential, but constructive feedback regarding one’s performance is even more vital to one’s improvement. If students fail to see their weaknesses in learning, they may hold themselves in high regards and be less critical about their knowledge and experience. By receiving critical feedback, students are better able to improve their learning process. This feedback can come from fellow peers, instructors, mentor or leaders. 
",Extremely accurate,,,,Moderately accurate,,,"Teachers are experienced indeed, but teachers can't know everything about a learner. By working in teams with peers, an individual shows a different aspect of his personality, learning style and knowledge gap. Therefore, peer-assessment is quite useful too. ",Slightly accurate,,,"Creativity sometimes comes not from one's closely-related field, but from other source he or she may not be able to identify. Learning about a broad range of topics and things is helpful and can spur one's creativity. If learning is only related to one's work, one's knowledge and interest will be largely limited. ",Extremely accurate,"When teaching, learners have to know their knowledge inside and out and make full preparation, so they end up learning more. ",,,Extremely accurate,,,,Extremely accurate,,,,Moderately accurate,,,"If the learner is preparing for a test, then one-on-one coaching is quite effective, but with large groups, one also can learn much as he or she can listen to others' perspective (if learners are given chance to voice out their opinion). ",Extremely accurate,,,,"Learning takes place anywhere, anytime, with anyone. I notice that many students and people assume that learning is only about learning specific knowledge, and the test of one's knowledge is only through a standardized test. That definition of learning is way too narrow to fit today's ever-changing world. Learning some knowledge is only one part of its intent. Inquisitive individuals learn about everything around them; they are very alert, sensitive to the changes and things; their minds are mostly active during the day rather than dormant. That attitude of learning is what I desire to achieve. ",Quite difficult,"I often have to pause, reflect and even correct my thoughts about those questions. ",Quite well,"Those provocative questions are very invaluable for me to think about my role as a learner and a teacher.

However, I (naively) thought at this stage that teachers were not really accomplishing anything themselves - they were training and relying on their students to accomplish things. It wasn't until later, when an opportunity arose through a ""Teach For"" program, that I seriously considered becoming a teacher and becoming directly involved in education. I now see education as one of the most important fields of work (both in terms of reducing poverty and enabling learning for the sake of learning), and I see teaching as a vital profession in and of itself. ","My focus has gradually expanded from that of classroom teaching to mid-level school leadership to education at the policy level and education as a global system. ","When I began teaching, one of my in-school mentors was very knowledgeable about learning theories and about school systems in general. This mentor gave me an excellent grounding in the importance of educational theory in classroom teaching and positive ways that teachers should interact with students. 
I was also influenced by people involved in the ""Teach For Australia"" program (sorry this is not a single person!). This was because they were focused on addressing educational disadvantage, and because a number of them had (like me) left other careers to go into education/teaching. They had a lot of energy and thought/reflected deeply about their role in each school community and their actions as teachers. They therefore allowed me to clarify my focus (on educational disadvantage), learn a lot in terms of teaching technique, and consider how I could make a positive contribution at my school. ","The most exciting aspects of education are:
- its proven potential to enhance people's lives and to make positive changes in societies (at all different scales)
- the fact that it often involves working with young people (and may change the opportunities available to them)
- the fact that it is so complex 
- the fact that there are so many areas of education that need further research/improved understanding","'- The fact that it is so complex

As a child, I would use my imagination to create my own classroom. I would organized the basement, so that it matched my idea of a learning environment. My younger sister was my one and only student. I would spend hours ""teaching"" her anything that popped into my head, and oftentimes ended up assigning her homework. My interest in education grew as I embarked on my journey as a student. I have always had a love of learning, and slowly that love transformed into a love of teaching. In high school, I began to fully immerse myself in the education field. I enrolled in courses that focused on education. I became involved in extra-curricular activities that had a foundation in education. It was really during this stage of my life that I was one hundred percent certain education was the field for me. This belief grew stronger during my time as an undergraduate student. I revealed in the opportunity to learn more about this field that had been on my radar since I was a young child. To this day, I cannot imagine what my life would look like had I not found this career. Educating others is a love of mine, and always will be. ","When I first started out in this profession, I imagined that I would always be an elementary school teacher. I thought my place would forever be in a classroom. However, as I have learned more and more about the opportunities that exist within this field, my goals have changed. There are many aspects of this field I hope to dabble in over the course of my career. I aspire to help develop curriculum for schools that focus on incorporating technology with literacy. I aspire to instruct future teachers at the university level. ","One of the teachers that greatly influenced my interest in working in the field of education was my sixth grade teacher. She always seemed to be ahead of the curve, incorporating what technology was available into the classroom. She was also the first person who actually gave her students some control. I remember teaching a small grammar lesson in her class. She wanted her students to be actively engaged. She wanted us to take ownership of our learning. Plus in that moment, I fully got to see my passion for educating. 

One of my high school teachers also had a great impact on my life. I was lucky enough to have a class with her almost every year of my high school education. She encouraged me to join an organization titled ""Future Educators of America."" I decided to take her advice, and it ended up being one of the best decisions I have ever made. It was through this organization that I learned to step out of my comfort zone, and challenge what others were saying. Without her help, I am sure I would be even quieter than I already am. ","Each day is completely different from the last, which is a feature that I absolutely adore about education. No one can say that this field is boring or repetitive. I wake up each morning excited about what that day will bring. Perhaps a student who has been struggling will finally get that ah-ha moment. Perhaps I will make a breakthrough with one of the students who has been resisting the chance to learn. Perhaps I will learn something new from on of my students. Each day is a mystery, and that is what makes my job exciting. ","The most difficult part of education is that the field is constantly changing, because of governmental laws and/or current research. I feel as if the education sector can never find the middle ground. We are always at one extreme or the other. This makes it difficult to instruct the future generation, because these extremes put constraints on what we are allowed to teach. Certain school districts are under the guise that following textbooks are the only way to appropriately teach children. Other districts believe that textbooks limit the teacher, and therefore offer no specific resources. Why is it so difficult to find a balance between both sides? This is a question I have asked myself numerous times during my three years of teaching. It is a questions I still do not have the answer to, but in order for our field to grow I believe we need to find common ground. ","I confront the challenge mentioned above by discussing my concerns with my colleagues. At least this way I am spreading awareness to one of the issues that confounds the education system. I have also spend a great deal of time reflecting on how else I can change this issue, and that is part of the reason why curriculum development is a passion of mine.

I don't often spend thirty minutes thinking about why I chose this profession, but I appreciated the opportunity to reflect and remember why education is a passion of mine. ",,,"Many people would have described me as a quiet child. I kept to myself most of the time. My parents always said I was the most content when I was sitting on the sidewalk, reading a book. It took me quite a long time to feel comfortable in my own skin, and to venture out into the world. When I started my undergraduate degree, I told myself that I would embrace all of the opportunities my university had to offer. I slowly started joining organizations, and as the months went by I realized how passionate I was about the education field. This passion led me to step outside of my comfort zone; I ended up running for president of one of the organizations. To my surprise and slight terror, I got the position. I was now the president of this organization. It was in the moment that I learned I could do much more than I ever thought possible. ","I am proud that I took part in that experience even though it was outside of my comfort zone. The only reason I had the courage to actually run for president of this organization was because of my previous teachers. They always offered support and encouragement. Despite their praise, I never fully believed in myself and therefore it took me an extremely long time to put myself out there and to believe that I was capable of running an organization. When I started college, their praise must have been in my subconscious and even from far away they were still encouraging me to reach for the impossible.

I had to find the courage within myself, in order to learn that I had the power to lead others. I do believe that my support system (family, friends, and teachers) did play a crucial role in getting me to that point; however it was my own decision to step outside of my comfort zone.

Reason #2: The opportunity that led me into the field was too good to decline. That was from my best friend in university. Since we've known each other well, I'd defenitely give it a try.","My initial goal when I just stepped into the field was to become proficient enough in the managing position so as to let the compay grow in scale. But that thought was gradually changing as my time on the seat and cases of students accumulate both accumulated. I realized that I might still need time to get used to the role of a general manager, while being there to help students and parents solve their problems can maximize my potential in education. ","Mother of my student L did influence me on how much I could do as an educator to help students build their values and shape their future. At first I would always consciously treat my clients (students and parents) in a businees manner, because after all we were profit-oriented and my time was exceedingly limited. Thus logically, services I provided completely focused on the company's mission to improve students' scores. But L's mother activated my gene as a conscientious educator and gave me courage to explore possible solutions to solve L's problematic learning habit caused by severe addiction to online games. Since then I have assisted the mother in correcting L's habits and mindset. Fortunately we accomplished the most ideal result. That story still goes in my mind as a motivator to remind me that one of the greatest things of being a educator is that you might be the very reason that children's life could be turned to the right track. ",Being able to help children find what is out there waiting for them and what aspires them most. I deeply hold the belief that educators are guides rather than knowledge injectors. And simply helping students explore countless possiblities is beautiful!,"Social acceptance in China for education idealism still needs time to ferment, educators for a lot of the times are struggling to adapt great ideas to practice. From what I experienced, accelerating pace of society defines everything under the cloud of utilitarianism. For educators, if each and every measure they take will eventually have to be assessed in the scale of students' scores and grades, anything that can potentially bring about long-term value will be disgarded by the market. But if education becomes only about short-term gain, how will these children being educated find answers for questions of their life, such as what is the meaning of life?","If the social ambience cannot be turned in short run, I will start from individual cases to shift people's view on education.

",No.,Not sure if years/hours of experience in education (appeared as a blank) could help define background.,"That was a talk with my high school maths teacher after a mock test. At the time, I was rather suffering from maths problems and counld't really find courage to solve them. My teacher told me this time the grade was still not good enough, but she noticed that I was making a very interesting mistake. 

Then she said it was interesting because it was a problem I could have known the solution. She concluded that way because she once brought up the same exact problem in class, with no one knowing the answer but me! From that time on, I realized that teacher knew i could be good at maths, and I started to believe in my potential, which led to my significant improvement in the following years.","I guess that was a typical kind of experience in which students themselves are not aware of the underlying educational significance at that point, while educators have to lead and shed light upon the discouraged and frustrated students. Fortunately my maths teacher had the consciousness and the kindness to do so. That's why I remain so thankful of her still today.","Actually when she did revelate that fact to me, she was receiving treatment for her severe hyperthyroidism. Everyone could notice her skinny shape of body resulting from regular medication and treatment. Putting that in context, the love she gave as a teacher was exceedingly moving and long-lasting. Especially becuase she mentioned facts that could easily be neglected. She could have let go of me simply because of lack of time which was certainly understandable.","That part that the teacher noticed and remembered very trivial positive learning experience and connected that experience in order to motivate me was extremely motivating for me.

Well done.,"My most memorable moments in my subspecialty surgical education were the one-on-one teaching experiences that I shared with my mentor.  Long before I understood the concept of educational engagement, that is exactly what I experienced.  My mentor was (is) a remarkable teacher, even now at the tender age of 71.  He is internationally renowned, but is very approachable.  He is brilliant, but is able to describe very complex medical and surgical concepts related to patient care.  He is impeccably well educated, but has a sense of humor.  These characteristics are contagious and should be emulated.  I have spent my 27 year career to date attempting to duplicate his teaching style in the lecture hall and the operating room with my interns and residents.  My mentor is an exceptional role model and an outstanding educator.","I took part in that experience because my mentor seemed to enjoy teaching in part in that manner.  My mentor requested that I drive us to the hospital one day per week, most commonly on Mondays.  The one-on-one teaching occurred during those times.  A very unique atmosphere existed for teaching during those moments that I cherish to this day, some 28 years after it occurred.  Many years later, I realize this manner of teaching represents the quintessential form of educational engagement.","The learning experience was personalized.  There were no set rules or routines.  Rather, the pedagogy was spontaneous and highly effective.  In these respects, my mentor represented a sounding board as I would prepare for the event by reading all weekend and creating questions in my head.  It is important to understand that these sessions occurred in 1989-1990, long before Google, PubMed, and WebMD, contemporary resources that could easily substitute for such activity in 2017.  This fact is what made the sessions so special to me.  In reality, I had no other means to pick someone's brain.

Even when learning cannot be one-on-one, I embrace the problem based nature and case based nature of learning.  Graduate medical education exemplifies the value of mentor based learning.  I learned this concept during my education in surgery.","I believe that one-on-one learning is not always practical in graduate medical education.

PowerPoint is simultaneously one the best and worst things that has occurred in education.  The ability to place hundreds of pieces of information in a one hour PowerPoint lecture is counterintuitively very unfavorable from an educational perspective.  The lack of interaction in such a presentation belies any true educational value to most members of an academic audience.  One could probably merely read the PowerPoint handout and skip the lecture, but this is not the intention of any form of education.  The motive of PowerPoint is noble, however.  The digital format should be student centered rather than curriculum centered, but my belief is that PowerPoint presentations fall short of that ideal.

In the context of this question, I suppose that talent can be considered to represent the initiative, passion, and motivation to realize the particular skill.  As such, I believe that this statement is accurate in that a skill can be present but the talent can be lacking such that high achievement is not realized with regard to that skill.",,,Extremely accurate,"I believe that a primary goal of any form of education should be to produce engagement in the primary learning environments.   The expressed intention of engagement is that it leads to additional, and occasionally more important learning, outside of the primary learning environment.

This goal is key, but not primary. ",,,Extremely accurate,"Learning begins in the primary learning environment, but must not stop there.  As explained by Bloom's six stages of learning, beginning with knowledge.  Knowledge is a simple exercise in learning and must begin in the primary learning environment.  The second stage of learning is comprehension, that probably does not occur in the primary learning environment for most students. Rather, comprehension probably occurs with reflection and represents the first stage of the conversion of passive learning to active learning.  The final stage of learning is evaluation, that undoubtedly requires the greatest degree of pontification.  It becomes clear to me, therefore, that only the first of six stages of learning occur in the primary learning environment.  The final five stages of learning require the engaged student to bring the learning process to fruition.  As such, learners are ultimately responsible or their own learning.  ",,,Extremely accurate,"I believe that challenging concepts can be mastered by students.  Effort clearly must be defined in this question.  I believe that effort reflects the combined work of the teacher, the engaged student, and a cohort of similar learners to reinforce the learning process.

Under ideal circumstances, this effort will result in a student learning challenging concepts.",,,Extremely accurate,"Personal motivation to learn is at the core of active learning.

And it hit me how many of them did not have any education, did not have the tools to find their place in the world. As a volunteer for different organisations, I found the same problem. I started volunteering as a tutor, working with both children and grownups and finally decided to work in a non-profit devoted to education. Now it is clear to me, the field of education is where I belong.","It is difficult to say. At first I wanted to be a teacher. Now, even though I would love to have the opportunity to teach and tutor from time to time, I would like to continue working in non-profits or NGOs. I believe my goals focus on making sure everybody has equal access to education and, at the same time, have the resources to succeed at it. ","My father, he is a history and philosophy professor. I have seen him transform the lives of many students. He has been teaching for almost 50 years, and he still loves it. He's an example of how much an educator can achieve. He taught me how important it is to be a responsible and devoted professional.

The second person is not an educator. I had the opportunity to teach an elderly woman how to read. Even though she could not use the knowledge to get a job or such, it was amazing to see how empowered she felt. She was a big influence on my deciding to work for equal access to education.","Changing lives, or at least, having the chance to do so. I think education gives people the opportunity to pursue their dreams, opens doors, opens minds. Helping in that process, even if it is a little is an amazing thing. 

It is also through education that one can fight prejudices and discrimination, I believe those are some of the most important problems our world faces today.","I think is difficult to, inside the classroom, give opportunities to all the children alike. As someone with no formal education in Education, I do my best, bu always wonder if I am doing things the right way.

Thinking about my current goals, the most challenging is making a difference to achieve equal access to education and, at least in countries like my own, making sure everybody gets to complete their schooling and actually learn something in the process. ","I hope to confront the first one with lessons about teaching and learning, hopefully also an internship that could give me the professional experience and guidance I need.

The second challenge, I hope to confront by gaining tools and learning about equality in education, specifically in non-profits and NGOs. I think public policy is very important for the improvement of education, but I believe you can achieve a significant amount of progress from ""outside"" the system, helping those the system is leaving behind. I hope to continue working in this type of organisations applying what I've learn both about teaching and inclusion.

Starting in Fall, moving until the beginning of summer. It reflects the pattern in the traditional Jewish calendar, too. I've never not been in the field of education.

My mother and father are both educators, if non-traditional ones. Advocates for public health and ceramic arts.

My passions in math developed from an early age, and I saw my teachers as heroes and icons. Knowing things was deeply valuable. 

Teaching others deepened this same love. As I've gotten older I've come to value the implicit curriculum as much as the explicit curriculum.","I went from wanting students to be capable of doing great things (or solving really hard problems) to wanting students to be excellent human beings and citizens. It makes me wonder how learning mathematics can deepen one's ability to be in touch with the human. 

I'm also more interested in issues of access and equity regarding mathematics. Which students are taught an algebra-skills curriculum, and which students are exposed to recreational mathematics that more accurately represents what math is? How can math circles or other groups work to increase access to these resources to both math teachers and their students?

How can I take my own enthusiasm for math and better share it with my colleagues?","PJ Karafiol immediately comes to mind. He has been a math teacher of mine, and then colleague, for almost fifteen years now. He showed me how educators are whole human beings, not just representatives of their subject area of expertise.

As a kid, I remember a few things very clearly related to my interest in learning: 1) I was fascinated by the idea of intelligence since it seemed to me that it was something people valued in others and it was a form of positive reinforcement (to be praised for being smart felt good), 2) it was something that could be improved the more time you devoted to it, 3) it actually felt good to learn new things - there was a sweet aftertaste in reviewing in my mind that which I had just acquired (perhaps it felt like a type of self-empowerment). In movies, I always admired characters who were exceptionally smart. 

While some of my peers associated school and learning with burdensome activities, I always associated learning with a positive experience which could also lead to other positive outcomes (higher grades meant opportunities for a scholarship, teachers being kinder, etc). 

I discovered education as a field when I signed up for a course on the psychology of education in college. I was fascinated by how learning - an inner process which I had felt connected to since I could remember - could now formally become the topic of study, class discussions, and research. 

My interest in the field of education, therefore, stems from very positive impressions around the experience of learning and a deep curiosity about how our mind works. As an end goal, I would love to help improve educational settings so that more children can create positive impressions around the experience of learning in school. ","My interest in learning was based on intellectual curiosity at first (I wanted to understand better how we learned and why certain things were easier to learn then others). However, a course I took in college -- the psychology of education -- introduced me to the kinds of problems schools face today and the need to improve key aspects of educational systems.  

About a year after College, I took 9-month backpacking trip through South America where I volunteered at a few local schools for underprivileged children. One of them - in Sucre, Bolivia - introduced me to some of the broader problems children face around the experience of learning. For instance, it was painfully clear that those children with trauma or difficult family situations were not prepared to learn in the same manner or as easily as those who arrived well-fed and had just been dropped off by loving parents. Throughout the day, a constant decision I had to make was whether to devote more time to helping them learn formal knowledge or to simply be a loving presence and provide care in an environment in which they felt safe.  

Pursuing an Ed.M. program now - with a little exposure to some of the intellectual and social problems around education - I am interested in the science behind learning but I also want to focus on leading initiatives to improve educational systems in underprivileged areas. ","Professor Susan Engel: she communicated such passion and curiosity for how children learned that it was contagious. She often started her classes with a story about a specific child in a specific learning situation which made us dive into different scenarios and gain better understanding of the range of problems in the field of education. She was also extremely open, inviting us to correct her when we thought one of her theories or explanations had a weakness. In short, she exposed us to what I considered an ideal learning environment in which we could reflect on learning issues in a respectful and constructive way. ","I find the research being done on cognitive science and how it can enhance education to be fascinating. Part of me would love to do research, particularly on how metacognition (and certain types of self-regulatory knowledge) can shape a child's trajectory around learning. I often think of the image of a student standing in front of two diverging paths: the path on the left represents an engagement with learning and all the opportunities and solutions that grow non-linearly as the learning gets richer; the path on the right represents a detachment from learning (in a formal sense), a lessening of curiosity, and a narrowing of possibilities that had once been open. And I think about the experiences and circumstances that influence a child in choosing one path over the other, and I want to influence this. I think that's exciting. ","Perhaps focusing on one specific thing when there are so many different factors influencing a student's experience around learning. In Mexico, it was frustrating to learn how resistant the educational public school system is to change when so many educators want to make it better. Perhaps the biggest challenge is administrative or political. I don't know how I can make a difference in that level yet so for now I want to focus on what changes I could make for systems that allow it. ","I want to learn more about public policy on the side, and how to influence organizations that are set in their ways. However, this is more of a long-term goal. My short term goal is to gain a better understanding of learning as a whole to then tackle some of those tougher challenges.

",Quite well,I really enjoyed thinking about the first open-format questions. Thanks!,"I might add that coming from a liberal arts background, I think it's really important (even in STEM programs) to never lose sight of the human component. We study and do research as humans in a specific context, and there are qualitative components of learning and the experience around learning that I think are very important for children to learn about. For instance, one activity we did in college was to think of ways to teach science through stories and to have them create those stories. While some programs may focus exclusively on formal knowledge in STEM, one of my goals is to figure out how to better branch subjects that some consider independent; for instance, English and Mathematics. ","I wonder if other sources of input might be interesting to compare - for instance, self-perceptions of intelligence, motivation, comfort or discomfort with challenging problems, etc. ","It's my senior year in college. I'm sitting next to Teague, a 9 year-old who agreed to be a part of an independent research project about children's thoughts on education. Teague, who attended the local primary school, very openly starts sharing his experience with learning math - the things he hates, the things he loves. The reason why this moment is important to me is because I discover how much children are aware of and can vocalize the specific issues in their education (few people seem to listen). His thoughts - contrary to what most teachers in Mexico think of young students - reflect a deep understanding of what works and doesn't work in the classroom. ","I wanted to test a hypothesis: that students, even at a very young age, are keenly aware of what works and doesn't work in a classroom and that these insights should help guide instructional design. I also wanted to collect enough data to identify patterns out of intellectual curiosity. ","In this case, the situation was inverted. I was the facilitator. However, I was gaining knowledge from Teague, a 9 year-old. Teague's answers were meaningful since they were open and reflective. ","The motivating component to this experience was to confirm my ideas about how aware children are of the qualitative components of education.

An aspect that made this a meaningful experience, in addition to what I learned by interviewing primary students, is that I organized it independently and really enjoyed carrying this project through (without having to follow a specific set of instructions). ","Learning from interviewing students was representative of how I generally prefer to learn in that I was able to have a sense of agency and flexibility in the process. It's especially neat when one feels that what one is learning about is meaningful in some way outside of the experience itself. In this case, I was able to use the answers I collected to write a paper and discuss the ideas with peers interested in the subject. It also shaped my understanding as an educator of how children learn math. ","The learning experience was not too different from how I generally prefer to learn. However, one thing that was different in this scenario was that I had little control over the experience itself. I wasn't sure at first if the students would open up and share their frustrations around learning math or if the answers would be superficial out of shyness. Some of the answers, however, were very reflective and open which made the independent project valuable.

Those are my most important identifiers, but they are also classifications that designate target groups and that place people like me at a disadvantage everyday. Despite these identifiers, I graduated from Yale University, I speak four languages fluently, and I am currently a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. All of this was possible due to the immense kindness, support, and motivation that I received from incredible individuals and institutions (the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, Greenhill School, and Yale). What I have experienced made me a firm believer that high expectations bring forth greatness and that given the opportunity to succeed, every child will do so. Therefore, when it came time to choose a career path, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to help and inspire people like me: students with incredible potential that are often overlooked due to their race, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or country of origin. ","After teaching high school juniors and seniors for two years at a very low-income, high minority school, I left motivated to delve deeper into education to increase my impact but I also walked away with a slight sense of hopelessness. I entered education to uplift and inspire low-income, black and brown students like me with the hope of bringing about a tangible change or improvement in the way they approached learning and their future goals. I wanted to see growth, not in test scores, but in motivation, mindset, and ways of approaching academic material, and I don't feel like I was largely successful in that. For the most part, to me it seemed that my students ended the year just as they started it: those that were disciplined continued to be disciplined, those that wanted to attend college continued discussing it, and those that had a fixed mindset retained it. While they all walked away with some knowledge of Physics after our year together, I largely don't think I was able to impact them at their core (in terms of who they are as individuals), and it wasn't for lack of trying. The student I taught had lived 16-18 years of their lives exposed to certain things, behaving a certain way, and nurturing a type of mindset by the time they encountered me, and I felt like it was too late to impact them in a personal way. My experience teaching high school opened my eyes to the importance of early childhood and elementary education, and it made me wish that I taught younger students instead. Younger kids have malleable minds that can more easily acquire skills that could change their future trajectories, so to this day, I am considering switching from high school to elementary to see if I could have a greater impact on the students there.","When I moved to the United States at the age of eight, I was incredibly lucky that my elementary school teachers did not let my ethnicity cloud their ability to see my potential and placed me into the Gifted and Talented program at Irving ISD. Then, in middle school, I was fortunate enough to have four teachers who were the epitome of educators. They looked at me and my black and brown peers and saw intelligence and incredible potential, so they taught us with the level of rigor, passion, and patience that is usually only present in the classrooms of privileged students. Were it not for them and other individuals who fostered in me a love for learning and gave me incredible opportunities, I would have never gone further than stereotypes or societal expectations say I should. Those teachers were a paragon of what an educator should be, and I seek to emulate them everyday.",What I value the most about education is the ability to make a positive impact on someone's life.,"The success of a student depends on far more than the quality of the teacher. A student is shaped by their families, their neighborhood, and a host of other factors that are outside of the educator's control, and the older the students are, the more difficult it becomes for the teacher to break the mindset and behaviors that have resulted from years of a failing education system, poverty, etc.. I had 16-18 year olds who did not know their multiplication tables and could not write a coherent, grammatically-sound paragraph, so it was extremely challenging to teach them Physics and AP Environmental Science knowing they lacked the proper foundation to tackle (and be excited about) more difficult science topics.","As I mentioned before, I would like to work with younger students (preschool-third grade) in order to help provide them with a solid foundation of skills (interpersonal and academic) that will allow them to tackle more difficult content later in life with eagerness. If I stay in high school, I need to do a better job of collaborating with the families, neighborhood, and communities that surround my students' lives.

- She created a course that merged Science with Italian, which are two of my biggest interests, but a lot of people don't naturally connect. With the creation of the course she formed a space where interdisciplinary learning was essential. 
- We were discussing some of Darwin's major works, so she had the Italian class meet at a place where we would be able to see a lot of the scientific evidence that guided that work: the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. 
- She chose some of Darwin's most important writings, but did not provide prompts or specific things to look for as we read. This gave me the ability to approach the work in the way that I wanted to (that is to say, gave me the flexibility to choose what to focus on and how to interpret it). 
- She had us discuss evolutionary biology in Italian, which was a first for me. All of my science instruction and discussion (in academic settings) has taken place in English, and for the first time I had the opportunity to discussed what I loved in a language that I loved.

There is a huge push now to cater to millennials by only using technology and hands-on activities, and while I truly believe there are merits in both, I do not think they should eclipse or completely efface traditional learning methods. The high school students that I taught knew about ""learning styles,"" and they held on too strongly (and perhaps incorrectly) to what that meant. They refused to learn in a way that did not match their preferred learning style, and most of them were kinesthetic learners, so they complained every time something involved reading or writing. To me, that's not what learning styles are supposed to be used for. It's great to know how one likes to learn, but he/she/they must also appreciate (or at least work through) the other learning styles. If you know you're a kinesthetic learner, that doesn't mean you are unable to learn if the activity does not involve movement.

As I worked more and more with STEM in K-12 settings, my interests shifted away from student life towards the things students were learning in order to prepare them for the modern work place. ","The first person to influence my interest in working in the field of education was my boss when I worked in Residential Life in college.  She gave me a lot of opportunities to work with complex decision making that I really enjoyed.

Once I began teaching, I worked with another teacher who was very interested in pushing the curriculum forward into computer science and robotics at our school.

I opted to pursue an art major late in my junior year, which culminated with a course called ""Senior Studio"".  In this course, all of the art majors that were planning on graduating that spring were placed in the same studio space.  Throughout the semester, each student was able to work on their own individual project for the course of the semester.  This project would be presented in a gallery show that was up during the last week of the semester.  There were a few key features of this experience that made this experience particularly meaningful.  First, the opportunity to work on an individual pursuit throughout the course of three to four months was incredibly eye opening.  I was able to try different things, research different areas of work, and, at the end, reflect on the journey that I took towards the work that I ended up completing.  Another piece that made this experience was the critiques of each of our works that occurred every two to three weeks.  Each student got a wall, or appropriate space, to set up for the critique so that their work could be seen as it was meant to be seen.  During this time, the entire class gathered to ask about your work, give feedback, and suggest similar artists' work for you to study.  Learning how to give and receive feedback in this way was immensely powerful for me.  Lastly, working concurrently with about 15 students was a great experience.  While nobody worked together, everyone worked towards a common goal.  Everyone was able to decide what that goal looked like for them.  Informal critiques would happen throughout the process.  The commonality in the process provided a lot of comforts.","I took part in that experience because it was required for me to in order for me to graduate, but also because I was excited about the opportunity to dive deep into an individual project for an entire semester.","I think that my professor did a few things really well.  He was really great at reading people and understanding their needs.  Some students he worked very closely with every class period, some students he largely left alone and would check in on them because that is the way that the student preferred to work.  He also brought in a litany of different artists in at various points in the semester.  He himself was a painter, but not everyone painted, so he brought in sculptors, video artists, printmakers, and even painters that worked differently than he.  This brought more feedback to the table, by way of different perspectives, which was incredibly valuable. ","I constantly felt like I was getting somewhere with my work, which was incredibly motivating.  Every time that I began to feel settled, stuck, or otherwise, we hit a critique and I was given what felt like 50 new ideas to explore.  My classmates were also incredibly motivated, too.

As someone who loves facing new, meaningful challenges, when it came time to choose how I want to impact the world, I could not imagine a better field to get involved in.","Originally, I entered education with the goal of becoming a high school English teacher. However, after completing my undergraduate degree in English Adolescent Education and receiving my initial licensure, I realized that teaching didn't feel like the right for me. I also realized that the classes I most enjoyed were my technology-based courses and that education technology would thus be a better path for me to follow.","In my senior year of high school, I volunteered at a program teaching research skills to third graders at a local elementary school. Every few weeks, the group of students would change, and, in the second rotation, I met a student who directly pushed me to pursue the field of education. This student was much louder and livelier than his peers and was thus considered a ""problem."" He preferred to run around the room to completing his reading and note-taking and, near the end of his group's time in the program, was far behind his peers. In one of the final sessions, my supervisor asked me to sit and work with him. Upon talking with him, I learned that this student found the given reading material too easy and was bored. I found an encyclopedia at a higher reading level for him to consult and sat with him as he worked through the entries relevant to his project. I watched him comment on facts he found interesting, work through words he didn't know, and connect the pictures to passages that they could be connected to - it seemed like I was watching a completely different student. That period, he finished his note sheet and went on to catch up with his peers. A while after a new group replaced his, I saw him in the hall, and he excitedly told me about his presentation (which I had unfortunately missed). This experience taught me that schools currently do not serve all their students, instead labeling the louder ones as ""problems"" and letting them fall through the cracks.

As a first generation Dominican-American it was a vital part of my upbringing.  I was raised to believe that education was the only path towards success.  I was lucky enough to have a natural inclination towards learning and so I did fairly well academically.  Soon enough I realized my educational experience was not the same for many of my peers so I eventually found myself in the field of teaching students from my own community and helping them find ways to discover the same benefits of education I did. ","I've been a high school classroom teacher for almost ten years now and wanted to excel in that area before I decided to delve into a more administrative role.  After some soul searching and life experiences I decided to tackle the challenge of becoming a school leader.  ","I think mentors and teachers I've had throughout my life have truly impacted me in a way that makes me almost feel like I have to give back that same level of motivation to others.  They also instilled a level of confidence in me I don't think I would have developed on my own. ",What drives my excitement in education is quite simply the students.  Most of my experience has been at the high school level and I've been able to witness the resiliency of many of these students firsthand.  I'm  also excited by the interest and genuine willingness of my colleagues in tackling issues of inequity and systemic racism,What is most challenging to me is probably the bureaucracy and political correctness our society seems to be obsessed with.  I think if we put the same level of energy into the actual work as we do in talking about the work we could accomplish so much more,I would like to think I will develop into the kind of leader who leads by example.

When I was in school I had so many interests that choosing a major was very difficult and I switched a few times. When I had the opportunity to be a TA for a few classes I found that I enjoyed explaining ideas and helping others learn and I delighted in watching them gain confidence as they began to understand or learn new skills. I had a joyful emotional reaction to working with kids in Special Olympics one summer and on other occasions and found it especially heartwarming to help them learn skills to become more self reliant and independent. I also enjoyed figuring out how to present things in a step by step process and have discovered that I can envision things fairly clearly sometimes that helps others understand better. Mostly I wanted to find a career that would pull together all my various interests and education seemed to be the most all encompassing field. ","For many years I worked as a para-educator in resource or special education classrooms or transition centers. I loved working directly with the kids and enjoyed teaching classes such as computer skills, cooking, yoga, job skills etc. After my divorce I needed to find full time employment that would offer benefits and had the opportunity to work at a charter school as the special education coordinator. It was overwhelming at times but I enjoyed the process of developing the program and advocating for our students with special needs, including our gifted students and English language learners. Many of these students also were dealing with mental health challenges such as anxiety or discouragement and I found that mental health, resiliency and social emotional skills were crucial to success regardless of intellectual ability. Since I need to support myself financially now I am always concerned about my ability to support myself and because I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Special Education the year before it generally became a Master's level program I realized I would be competing for jobs at a disadvantage. In general I would like to find a niche in education where I can best utilize my strengths and feel that my enthusiasm is valued. I am concerned that education has a tendency to lead to burnout and I want to protect my work/life balance and well being while being able to help others build better lives through education. ","My co-workers have had a profound effect on my goals as an educator. I have seen many people struggle and burn out and try to deal with stress without adequate support or resources. I value shared leadership and kindness and a supportive community and have experienced the bureaucracy and gender discrimination and overwhelm that many teachers deal with on a daily basis. I feel fortunate however to have found co-workers who truly care about their students and others and have left public education to start their own businesses providing educational support services such as tutoring and family advocacy and yoga and stress relief. They have made me think outside the box and be willing to take risks and advocate for students and for what I feel is right. ","I think that the growing awareness that mental health, resiliency, social emotional skills and other wellness needs impact education is exciting. That the old ways of doing things such as shaming or criticism is being researched and found to be ineffective is wonderful and I think will truly transform education. I also love project based learning and the effort to help students gain the skills to deal with real world problems will make it so much more relevant to students. I also think that the effective use of technology as well as teaching students the skills to code is an area that needs to be explored more. Learning how to think more than what to think seems so vital to students in this world and being able to help them access creativity and inner resources will be a vital part of the shift we as a world community need to make to create a better world. ","The lack of support both financially and emotionally. Our society places blame on education for many failures without realizing that breeds distrust between students and teachers. The expectations that society and parents place on schools is huge and yet there isn't the equivalent level of respect or support. ","One job, one student, one parent, one co-worker at a time. I can only move forward and try to do my best. Continuing to build a network for support and collaboration with like-minded educators seems like the best way to make positive changes and help where there is a need. This sounds very vague but mostly I will try to do my best when I'm at work and make sure I fill my reserves when I get home so I have something of value to give the next day. I also think that if I can find a job that feels meaningful and builds on my strengths I will find fulfillment even if the job is difficult. Special education can be especially challenging because often times parents are dealing with their own frustration and discouragement, so having compassion and empathy as human beings makes it fulfilling. However, when dealing with people who are critical and negative and not willing to try to find solutions I also don't have to take it personally and can wish them love and light and let it go.

I have the sense that my goals will change after my year at HGSE because of exposure to new opportunities and I hesitate to limit my goals based on current awareness. Essentially I don't know what I don't know so pondering my background or goals may or may not help me move forward and build on my strengths to explore avenues that I haven't even considered yet. 

The section with the words to describe myself as a learner however was quite difficult because it really depends on the topic I am learning. If I were to be required to learn some math concept for instance I would have to put hesitant or reluctant whereas if I am learning something I'm more confident about or interested in I would write focused or enthusiastic.

","I'm interested in entrepreneurship in education and I have some of that in both my background and goals but am not quite sure how to address that. 

I really feel like having a conversation with another person helps in my thought process more than just pondering on my own and that goals cannot be created in a vacuum when you need to work with other people. ","I would consider providing more options for the words describing how you learn to include particular topics or subject areas because I don't think we learn everything the same way. 

I would consider adding more guiding questions about the background sections to help connect with the individuals goals but I'm not sure if this section is just about trying to get a snapshot of the current individual situation or if it is trying to help focus thoughts to get to a particular thought outcome or product. In many ways receiving feedback or questions to clarify helps the individual also clarify their thoughts and it is unclear if this section is designed to just help start the thinking process in general or work towards a particular end. 

","Talking with Jeri about the intersection of our brain function and emotions and how to process emotions in order to deal with anxiety, calm down and move forward with learning. This was helpful for me as an individual and as a teacher to better be able to help my students when they were dealing with high anxiety situations and when calm help them understand how our brains react to stress when trying to learn. ","I was searching to understand how to process my own emotions surrounding difficult situations from the past and how to support my students dealing with stressful life circumstances. ","Jeri explained how the brain functions under stress with clear and simple ways that could be used to also help a student understand. She also taught me how to evaluate my own stress levels and somatic responses and gave me the support and space to process the physical response to emotions with greater understanding of the time and patience required. She was kind, attentive, patient and clear in her explanations.

Previously I had had a mental understanding of how to deal with emotions but was disconnected from the physical process of doing so. Learning to recognize the physical aspects of emotions helped me learn that I didn't have to ignore emotions but could pay attention to the physical response and honor the process of acknowledging them and letting them work through the para-sympathetic nervous system response to achieve better balance. ","I generally am very mentally engaged in learning but don't really engage my body. I think that this has limited my understanding in some cases and that more hands-on learning experiences can bring a deeper understanding of many topics. ","It was very reflective and personal and required a willingness to be vulnerable. In the past I have preferred to learn by reading or listening more so than by engaging in activities or taking risks or exploring and trial and error. ",Moderately difficult,"It was difficult to think of an experience that seemed relevant. I also wasn't sure if it was the type of learning or topic you intended.

For instance if I were to need to learn something technical or fact based how do I prefer to learn? Or if I need to learn something skill based how do I prefer to learn? My experience was not something experienced in the typical school based setting so perhaps that is how I prefer to learn? ","I really enjoy learning many things and am usually reading a few books at a time, enjoy having conversations with others to gain understanding and find inspiration from multiple sources. However, having more often had no other choice than to learn on my own rather than with a teacher or facilitator I don't know that I learn efficiently even if that is my prior preference. I would also wonder if there could be some sort of list of ways to learn to help with the process of remembering and evaluating various learning experiences. Sometimes I may be learning and not realize it so the opportunity to self reflect on a variety of learning preference options could be helpful. ","Through the questions it wasn't clear that I was to be considering my own learning preferences until the end of the section. It is also a bit unclear as to what a learning preference really can be. Just because someone has been exposed to particular learning experiences doesn't mean that would be the way they would prefer to learn.

I personally remember the struggles I faced relating to my former teachers and while many of them were very good, they just were not able to connect to specific demographics. 

As a first generation Mexican-American and former military veteran, I felt I was able to provide students with a different perspective to help them grow not only in academia but as an individual. ","I believe my interests have changed the more exposure and experiences I have up to this point. Initially, I was focused on working primarily in early childhood through middle school. However, once I had an opportunity to work with adult learners (e.g. immigrant ELL and GED students) I developed more of an appreciation for lifelong non-traditional learners. 

Additionally, as I reflected on my own educational journey, I was able to connect with students because I myself was/am a non-traditional learner. In this vein, I was able to provide students with the very connections I was hoping to gain from my past teachers. ","One recent influence that comes to mind was my main academic adviser at my previous university. While reading her bio, I noticed she had attended an ivy league university but she never mentioned her educational background. During those years, I had a very narrow-minded view of education and especially Ivy-league schools, I viewed those institutions as unattainable fantasies for someone like me. Furthermore, I had a perception of professors would be elitist and pompous but she opened my eyes and really made me change my views.

Having her as an educator demonstrated that I was allowing my insecurities to alter my views and was only viewing education from a one-dimensional lens. The same things, that bothered me when others labeled me in a certain light. Lastly, it was her who recommended I look into applying for Harvard in the future because she felt I had a great deal of experience to contribute. I am very thankful, she was such an influential person in my life and that is the mark of a true educator. ","I value opportunities for growth that extend far outside of the classroom.

When it comes to academe, or, specifically the field of psychology, studies are primarily accessed and read by other researchers in peer reviewed journals. After attending numerous psychology conferences that undoubtedly furthered our field's knowledge about how the human brain, social interaction, and learning work I thought it important to use those findings to reach broader audiences that could harness it, and apply it in their own work to help others. Because learning from others (e.g., parents, siblings, peers, teachers, mentors, public figures etc.) is a key component of human development, especially in the early stages of life, the fields of psychology and education could benefit from sharing information with one another.","As a developmental psychologist, I have become interested in the earlier phases of life and how moral values, character strengths, emotions, creativity, and intrinsic motivation develop and impact learning so that young people can find a passion that is meaningful to them, and to then work towards developing their skills so that they can invest back into their communities while enjoying what they do at the same time. The more I studied different areas of psychology, I realized that bridging the gap between research, policy, and practice would be instrumental in finding real solutions when it comes to designing curricula and helping children from diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic needs thrive. Admittedly, these interests are still developing, which ties into the question above: ""Why did I become involved in the field of education?""","Education is everywhere; not just in formal classroom environments where young people interact directly with teachers and classmates, but out there in the real world where they learn from parents, peers, and public figures, be it in political office, iconic influences, human rights activists, and/or celebrities. I distinctly remember one English teacher in high school who constantly pushed me to pursue what I was interested in, and what I was good at (at the time it was music). This teacher would make an effort to attend our Jazz recitals and talk to me after class about particularly moving moments. To this day, I think about this individual who encouraged me to find alternative paths and pursue my own creative interests, even if it wasn't by walking a ""paved road."" I realized then, that good teachers are perceptive to individual interests and talents, and have a knack for engaging in personalized teaching. Good mentors are extremely important. As I entered my undergraduate studies, I similarly attached myself to one professor in particular who aligned with my interests. Her passion for teaching was clear and she had the same impact. Then again in graduate school. As I reflect on these individuals, their influence had the most salient impact on where I am today. But now, my PhD advisors and their work are what propel me to learn as much as I can -- both theoretically and empirically -- about future directions in psychology and education.","I look forward to learning how practitioners and policy makers can work together to help children of all backgrounds, and all sociocultural contexts, excel at their interests and become global, moral citizens. Furthermore, the field of education captures a broad array of disciplines rooted in behavioral sciences, many of which stem from the psychological sciences.","Understanding the inner workings of teachers and classrooms themselves. As I myself am not an educator in a traditional sense (I am a developmental psychologist dealing with experimental designs and ethnographic studies), I think it is important to understand what works, and what doesn't, on the ground. For psychologists to better implement and design experimental studies, they need to listen to how members of the field of education experience their daily lives, and what they think the most pressing issues for their students are. Otherwise, lab controlled experiments will fail to address external validity and stagnate on a non-generalizable format.","By studying at HGSE! Really though, my goal in this program is to learn how to tackle the issues mentioned in previous responses. Though I am trained in human development, I want to learn more about specific issues teachers face -- especially when it comes to addressing the needs of diverse students, students who need additional help realizing their potential, and students who do not traditionally have certain advantages at their disposal. By learning from my cohort and members of the HGSE community, coupled with hands-on research supported by my advisors, I hope to gain more insight on how to bridge the gap between research, policy, and practice.",Other (please specify):,Academia; research; policy.,,,,,,,,,,,Researcher and policy maker.,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,,,Extremely valuable,Not at all difficult,"I was honest. I applied to HGSE for very specific reasons, and to work with specific people. Again, this is a unique case because I am a doctoral student at another institution, already have a Master's degree in psychology, and at this stage of my studies, have a clear outlook for what I want to study here, how to further hone my skills, and where gaps in my knowledge exist. That being said, the prompts were clear and I instinctually remembered key individuals in my life who have helped me find my path and achieve my goals (or at least, strive towards achieving my goals). At the same time, priming participants in this course by asking them to reflect on previous experiences and to think about their future goals is an appropriate way to reevaluate why they are here and what they hope to achieve -- both for the faculty reading these responses as well as for the students who will be taking this course.",Quite well,"Overall, the reflection exercise served its purpose. The prompt was clear, there was no time pressure (but was good to have a general sense of how long, on average, this should take), and offered the participant agency in deciding the format of the response. However, in these types of exercises, reflection at times occurs after submitting original responses. For example, many people shaped my interest in the field of education that I did not mention in my original response. Even as I write this, I can think of others who were instrumental in pursuing my goals and interests.",,"One recommendation I have is to perhaps reframe the question about ""goals and values as an educator"" so as not to limit the final outcome profession to ""educator."" Because HGSE has 13 Master's programs, not all students might come here to learn to become an educator (e.g., Higher Ed versus HDP or MBE), or teacher per se. Personally, I would like to use my training in psychology to conduct research in education that will help me achieve my goal of becoming a better developmental psychologist, university professor, researcher, change agent, policy maker, and even government advisor. ","More recently (approximately one year ago), one particularly meaningful learning experience took place in my PhD advisor's home. I remember thinking about the future direction of our specialized domain of psychology and how we, as members of the field, would be able to make further advances in terms of research and theory development. My advisor often invites me to his home when we are working through a particular puzzle. This, I think benefits both of us as it removes interruptions introduced by time constraints. In these informal settings, I am able to probe his thoughts, while at the same time learn about his mental models that in turn contribute to my own understanding of how to become a more professional student, advisee, and ultimately, colleague.

Present at this particular meeting was also his wife, who later joined us in discussing his early publications and books. At first our meeting began outside with a cup of tea and snacks. It was here where I managed to pose my first overarching question about how to achieve the next big breakthrough in our area rather than remain in ideological echo chambers that resonate in peer reviewed journal articles and conferences. What research questions could we ask? How could we revise current methodologies? And how could we make that research applicable to peoples' lives? Perhaps rather naively I was looking to make a paradigmatic shift without noticing the smaller accomplishments that contribute to larger ideas.

A conversational meeting that was meant to last one hour, maybe even two, ended up with us talking about dilemmas of psychology over the course of six or seven hours. At times we would walk around the house, exploring the meaning of different objects, artworks, photos, and books scattered throughout -- each painting a clearer picture of who my advisor was as a person, how that contributed to his curiosity, and how it aligned with mine. In the end, I walked away knowing that we had built a more personal relationship I think is critical to any mentor-mentee dyad.","Specifically because I wanted to (and my advisor had free time in his busy schedule!). My advisor is someone I deeply admire. He has accomplished what I dream to do in the coming years and is able to ""nudge"" me in the right direction without ever pushing me towards one interest or another. More specifically, I took part in this experience because I wanted to gain in depth understanding of the hurdles he experienced when he was a student in my position, and to also ask direct advice about a particular research question.","He provided personal attention, lack of interruption, and an open environment where I could be critiqued by an expert.","I was motivated by my advisor's willingness to spend time with me one-on-one in an informal setting, discussing questions and concerns that began broadly, then narrowed as the hours passed. Importantly, he listened to my questions and concerns, and was willing to reply with his own experience and wisdom. As opposed to formal class settings, we were able to maintain an uninterrupted flow of conversation. However, this comes at a cost, because it is crucial to introduce multiple perspectives from other students as well. For example, if my advisor and I come to an agreement, another perspective offered by a third party was absent, which if present, might lead the conversation in a new direction.

That being said, I was motivated by the accessibility of my advisor. After taking many formal classes with him, it was comforting to know that I have a strong, intellectual support system that is willing to take time (on the weekend no less) to address some of my burning questions. As I witnessed my advisor's openness and willingness to engage my thoughts, I was motivated to generate new ideas -- some that might be overzealous -- but I understood then that I had someone to help sort through some of the junk so that I might arrive at more reasonable approaches.",,,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,,Extremely accurate,,Quite accurate,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,,,,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,Quite accurate,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,Quite accurate,Moderately accurate,,,Not at all accurate,Extremely accurate,Quite accurate,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,Extremely accurate,,Extremely accurate,,,,"This is a tricky question because while this particular learning experience stood out as what I decided to reflect on, it is by no means representative of my learning style in totality, or, in general. It was merely one of the many ways I feel empowered to learn. However, it is true that I work well in informal settings, but in order to be able to meaningfully interact in these settings, I need a foundational knowledge base, which could not be acquired without previously participating in formal learning sessions (such as classes, lectures, group projects, or collaborative lab work).","In reference to my response above, while the personalized attention was invaluable, it lacked outside perspective. In other words, because there were no other students or professors present, our ideas could not be critically questioned. The learning experience, for me, is ultimately an amalgam of contexts critical to developing a better understanding of particular subjects. In other words, multiple angles are needed. I cannot have a one-on-one with my advisor if I have nothing to ask, but without getting the thoughts of my advisor, I would not be able to progress in my interactions with my peers.",Slightly difficult,"For me, learning is comprised of many different components, and it is somewhat difficult to capture all of those components in a single learning experience. While I was swiftly able to think of a meaningful and memorable learning experience, by no means was it representative of my learning style as a whole. Otherwise, subsequent questions that stemmed from the initial reflection were worded clearly and did elicit those aspects of the learning experience that made it powerful.",Quite well,"The followup questions to the initial reflections served the purpose of identifying certain aspects of my learning preferences, but not all. I think, however, that this boils down to personal preference and that some students are indeed better at learning in groups, and others individually (for example). However, often times my experience has been that learning style is a complex construct that manifests differentially across contexts, and one cannot parse those differences without being exposed to different experiences.","One thought that permeated my responses throughout this section was that while indeed beneficial for incoming Master's students, I think an exercise such as this would be especially powerful for younger students (e.g., secondary school, high school, and college). In graduate school, we are going to be exposed to different learning contexts regardless of our personal learning style preferences. And that is equally important because it serves the purpose of challenging us and stretching our comfort zone.","This section was clear. However, it might benefit from adding an additional box in the beginning where students can reflect on two different, yet equally meaningful and powerful learning experiences (depending on time constraints and space limitations of the course overall). This might better serve the purpose of understanding learning style across different contexts, or could be useful for unpacking different components of one's learning style that would not otherwise surface in a single experience. (Similarities might better be analyzed across two contexts as well.)",Quite accurate,"Human development is both experience expectant and experience dependent. For example, typical neurodevelopment includes cognitive processes such as object permanence, language acquisition, mental rotation, motor skills, working memory, and numerical cognition just to name a select few. These are referred to as experience expectant developmental mechanisms that emerge across specified ""stages"" of early life (they are expected to develop in healthy humans in particular periods). Thus, stage theory is important for better understanding how a 6-month old responds differently to stimuli than a 6-year old. 

In addition, as the brain develops in the early years, exposure to particular contexts and experiences impact synaptic blooming and pruning. Examples include experiential learning through play, creative exploration of different objects, exposure to different activities, as well as nutritional intake and socioeconomic status. These experience dependent mechanisms also offer variation in developmental trajectories and should be accounted for (here, development depends on context).

While classical theories in psychology emphasize stages, more contemporary paradigms bolstered by advances in fMRI technologies provide evidence of neuroplasticity, suggesting that the brain's hardwiring is malleable even in later phases of life. Learning extends throughout the lifespan and becomes very much a product of experience dependent mechanisms. Thus, while understanding critical and sensitive periods in terms of stage theory is important for understanding how humans at different developmental periods optimally respond to external stimuli, change over time occurs well beyond such periods and is impacted by many factors including human agency.",,,Moderately accurate,,,"It's not necessarily the ""most"" important, but certainly plays a role. Genetics I think account for approximately 50% of variability in certain personality characteristics while the rest depends on contextual experiences. Learning can always take place, and often is commensurate with the yardstick by which it is measured.",Slightly accurate,,,"There has been much debate about the malleability of inherent (inherited) intelligence. Again, this depends on the measures used, and I argue that the traditional Wechsler Intelligence Quotient does not capture important components of diverse dimensions of intelligence (e.g., interpersonal, intrapersonal, spatial, mathematical, linguistic, musical etc.). So, a response to this question depends on how ""intelligence"" is operationalized. Some studies point to a fairly stable IQ score throughout the lifespan with minute variability, while others indicate boosts or declines. Additionally, it depends on the age of participants at assessment. Perhaps a healthy teenager who takes the same test well into old age will exhibit declines in IQ.

Ultimately though, if intelligence is framed as skills and abilities, or socio-emotional competencies and non-cognitive skills, then ""intelligence"" is absolutely not determined at birth. It then falls under the experience dependent category of human development. For instance, helping students foster growth mindset and grit can be instrumental in facilitating optimal learning outcomes across the lifespan.",Not at all accurate,,,"No. Much of this depends on intrinsic motivation and honing skills commensurate with appropriate levels of challenge. Talents are not finite. In fact, I argue that they are infinite. There is a wealth of knowledge and opportunity to build skill available to people of all ages, and it will depend on where they find optimal levels of flow experiences to harness their skills into genuine talents. Importantly, individuals must find a skill that intrinsically motivates them to develop their talent, which in turn makes developing that skill / talent an enjoyable experience. 

Also what is the directionality here? Is it talent to skill; or skill to talent? I think these are bidirectional and mutually beneficial components of learning. For instance, high skill - low challenge activities elicit boredom; high challenge - low skill activities introduce anxiety; low skill - low challenge apathy; but high skill - high challenge activities contribute to the ""sweet spot"" of finding flow. If individuals can be motivated by apathy, boredom, or anxiety to continuously increase both skill and challenge to higher levels in a given activity, then the activity becomes personally rewarding and meaningful. It is then possible to zero in on a particular skill / talent pair, and to even discover new ones.

Indeed, all humans personify diverse sets of intelligences, and are not incapable of strengthening them. Importantly, teachers, mentors, and other strong support systems (e.g., family, peers etc.) are paramount for unveiling hidden talents and/or skills.",Quite accurate,"Yes and no. Independent learning should be coupled with interdependent learning. It is important to first understand the basic components of a particular domain of knowledge before heading back to the independent drawing board. I refer here to the notion of complexity in human systems. Divergent thinking followed by convergent thinking can take place independently, but without being able to understand how to diverge thoughts into multiple perspectives, convergence cannot happen.

In addition, working in groups, collaboratively can be essential to personal and professional growth. However, I think this response depends on one's learning style. Some learners are more introverted while others more extraverted. To take advantage of psychological complexity, some combination of the two would be useful.
",,,Moderately accurate,,,"Yes and no. This depends on their current level of skill as well as age group. In early childhood for example, I believe exposure to multiple contexts, activities, and methods of exploration contribute to experiential learning. Without foundational knowledge, it can be difficult take responsibility for one's own learning. This also depends on the framing of ""responsible."" In this context does responsible infer ""obligated?"" Learning is often a collaborative process, especially during adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood. On the other hand, if there are explicit or tacit rules embedded in a particular domain (e.g., college course, professional work) then the individual can be responsible for learning how to execute a given task. In sum, this very much depends on the person -- for who and under what conditions.",Extremely accurate,Absolutely. Fostering a growth mindset could be key to conquering even the toughest of mountains.,,,Extremely accurate,"Yes. Intrinsic motivation has been shown to provide a buffer against stress and anxiety associated with burn out and job / academic dissatisfaction. By leveraging enjoyment associated with intrinsically relevant goals and activities, young people can learn to love the process of achieving those goals. In contrast, extrinsic rewards (such as high letter grades) have been shown to foster environments of high competitiveness, cheating, and a suite of negative emotions. Additionally, providing ample support and scaffolding has been shown to boost growth mindset and intrinsic motivation. ",,,Moderately accurate,,,"With help, learners can better identify how to approach and strengthen their unique skills. But before skills can be leveraged, preferred activities should be selected by the learners. Once learners understand what works for them, they can then apply that knowledge to tackle new concepts.",Quite accurate,"I think this question could be rephrased. Anyone can think deeply about concepts, but to think in a meaningful, or appropriate, direction about a given concept, it is critical to have a foundational understanding. Also, this would depend on the domain of interest. Philosophical questions -- moral goodness for example -- can be discussed by experiencing events across contexts, somewhat like virtue ethics. Mathematical equations on the other hand require an understanding of symbolic representations and specific maxims in order to think deeply about next steps towards the solution.",,,Quite accurate,"Yes, though still under debate, and dependent on level. Some studies point to stress as having an ""inverted U"" or ""goldilocks"" effect on achievement motivation and learning. Little to no stress could be thought of as boredom, while too much stress can provoke fear or anxiety. However, if the stress is ""just right"" or proportional to an individual's tolerance, then it can motivate learning to alleviate stress by stretching skills.",,,Extremely accurate,Absolutely!,,,Quite accurate,"Yes, I think this would help. But I also think it is important to experience different formats to better understand diverse approaches to learning, and to also challenge one's preconceptions of learning style. However, some methods work better for some than for others.",,,Moderately accurate,,,"Developing a specific skillset is instrumental to fulfilling basic needs provided by income. In addition, using ethical dispositions to generate good work can be rewarding both to the employee as well as the intended beneficiaries of the product. But learning is not only about developing skillsets associated with consumption. It is about opening dialogue about diverse points of view and capitalizing on non-cognitive socioemotional competencies that build positive relationships with others. While job skills contribute to well-being in the form of monetary capital, learning to interact builds social capital. Both contribute to the overall quality of life. ",Quite accurate,"I think this depends on the learning environment. In some real life situations (i.e., professional work later in life) specific demands will need to be fulfilled. However, throughout this section we have been unpacking the idea that different people respond to different methods of teaching, and that could depend on genetic predisposition, or experiential learning across contexts. I do think it is crucial to allow younger students to demonstrate their abilities in a manner that contributes meaningfully to a particular domain of knowledge, but at the same time it is important to develop basic skills that can be understood by others.",,,Quite accurate,"""High expectations"" should be relative to a learner's current abilities. Some might begin on the higher end of the spectrum, so the bar should thus be raised higher. Others who might need more training should still set the bar above baseline in order to stretch their skills, but could it be useful to not have the bar set at the same height as those who have already mastered certain aspects of a particular skill. In the end, all learners should develop an intrinsic motivation to achieve high expectations that make sense to them.",,,Slightly accurate,,,"There is a difference between process praise and standard praise. That being said, this statement should be unpacked further. Critical feedback is important to forming realistic conceptions of how to get better at something. With process praise, an educator can explain why something went well, or did not go as well. To me, both are technically considered positive encouragement, but it might be worthwhile to introduce a bit of ""positive criticism"" so that the learner doesn't simply think that they have already achieved proficiency.",Extremely accurate,"Yes. It is crucial to learn from mistakes, and mistakes are made by taking risks. Furthermore, risks often pay off if a student / learner has misjudged their own capabilities. In parallel, taking risks can often lead to a better understanding of one's capabilities, which can then be adjusted based on the result of the risk.",,,Quite accurate,"It depends on the experience of the peer. For example, a TA can be considered a peer, and they are assumed to know the content of the material that they are teaching, so should be able to provide useful feedback. Whether this translates to younger learners in elementary school, I'm not sure. Ultimately, the teacher is the expert and mentor, and is theoretically most capable of offering the most useful assessment of learning.

However, if a young person is learning about the rules of a handball court, it is possible that a more skilled peer could offer direct or indirect advice. Social learning theory suggests that young people learn vicariously by observing the actions of others. This example underscores the importance accounting for what is being taught.",,,,,"I'm not sure what the research says about this. If the question implies that teaching concepts to be relatable, then I agree. But sometimes, subjects like math don't immediately reveal a relatable scenario. Some students only later find that computation helps immensely in daily life (going to the store or budgeting for example). I do think it is useful to provide examples of why a particular subject can be useful, even if it is not a primary concern of the student at the time.",,Extremely accurate,"It is always beneficial to engage in opportunities that allow students to demonstrate what they have learned. By teaching something to others, they are putting their knowledge into action. By acting upon their knowledge, they might better identify gaps in their own knowledge. That's why it can be important to say ""I don't know the answer to that."" ",,,Extremely accurate,,,,Extremely accurate,"Engaging in dialogue about diverse points of view can help students explore concepts from multiple angles. For example, disagreements often surface due to differences in values, which are personified by experiences across diverse contexts. Before ruling out another side completely, one should be willing to openly, and respectfully, understand why a different opinion is being made. By appropriately navigating such disagreements, students will develop a broader understanding of the issue.",,,,,This could depend on the individual's learning style.,,Extremely accurate,,,,,Slightly difficult,"The answer to this question will depend on a participant's prior knowledge of specific concepts in the behavioral sciences, most specifically, psychology. At times, I wasn't quite sure if there was a definitive yes or no answer, as many of these studies are based on means. Some techniques work ""significantly"" better than others, which suggests that a majority of students respond in a particular way. If studies rely solely on statistically significant differences, then they neglect those students who do not respond well to particular interventions or teaching styles.

Two years older than myself, he was my closest sibling. I adored him. 

After another stroke caused by a brain aneurysm, he went into a coma for an extended period of time, and when he emerged, he struggled with his motor skills. He was once the fastest child in our neighborhood. Now, he struggled to sit up, hold his own utensils to eat, or even remember who his closest friends and family were. Over the next two years, he went through intense physical therapy to learn to use a wheelchair. Hopefully, one day. he would relearn to walk. My family was poor, and we struggled getting my brother the services he needed while he was out of school (like in-home tutoring). So, I remember getting off the bus everyday after school, running home with my books, and sitting next to my brother on his bed as I taught him whatever I learned that day. This went on for two years.

6 years later, I went to college as a pre-pharmacy major. Later, I got accepted into a great medical school, but I was bored. I called my brother one day and told him that it didn't make sense. I was on track to be successful and financially stable, but I was so sad.

He said, ""Why aren't you an education major?""

It was like he saw right through me. And I've never turned back.","After teaching and coaching teachers in low-income settings for five years, I realized that there were so many problems outside the four walls of my classroom, and the real struggles of my students were in the policies of the school and school district, the politics of the school board and superintendency, and the economics of the school district, local community, and state, all of which I had little to no influence over. Because of this, I felt like i could teach 2000% for the rest of my life and nothing in my school district would get better. I started to broaden my interests from teaching and teacher coaching to ed law, politics, policy, and economics.","My older brother, first, as he got me to believe that a career in education was a possibility. He was also my most challenging student. His frustration at having his annoying little sister know more than him made him obstinate and surly. His lack of motor skills made holding a pencil difficult, and he would often have very emotional, aggressive outbreaks. After teaching him, there was no student I couldn't be patient with, and I carried those general values with me. Patience, not taking things personally, relationship-building, and beginning and ending with love.

After college, I joined Teach For America as a way to gain more leadership experience in the field of social justice but also to give me more time to figure out what I wanted to do as a career. I found that what I had perceived as an obstacle (i.e., my inability to choose a specific career path) was one of my greatest assets for advising and connecting my own students along their individual journeys to college and career. I began dreaming up a school system which doubles down on this approach through its programming and am now at Harvard to build the capacity to create and lead such a school of my own. ","I have always loved the classroom setting, both as a student and teacher. I have always been interested in school leadership, starting as early as my first year in the classroom. I have always had a passion for social justice and educational excellence for all students. 

In my first year of teaching, I considered being a lawyer to fight social justice through the legal system but changed my mind as I started going through the application process forced me to think more critically.

I originally wanted to lead in a traditional public school but have changed my approach to one that allows me more flexibility in designing and managing the school. This changed within the last year on the counsel of my Executive Director as I was sharing with him my goals. 

Throughout the past two years, I have undergone a series of racial identity development which has instilled in me the importance of ensuring racial equity as a part of my professional and personal goals. 
","My 11th and 12th grade English teachers: Mrs. Susan Hitman & Mrs. Mickey Dyer. They have served as a model for me of who excellent teachers are. They taught me style, challenged me to become a writer with flare, expanded my vocabulary, and, above all, showed me that the most important thing I can learn is how to treat others. ","I'm most excited about the fact that through education we are shaping society's future. Teachers' relationships with their students is the most direct institutional lever that determines how socially, economically, and politically rich our country will be, based on the beliefs and habits they instill. 

A very close second for most exciting thing about education is the joy of being a part of each student's individual development, witnessing their milestones and a-ha! moments. ","My greatest challenge was overcoming my own and other's assumptions about how small my locus of control was in being able to improve school administrative functions from the role of a teacher. The narrative in my head would always be how I would've done this or that so much differently to more effectively organize everyone on the team to establish and uphold a set of clear goals for a school; but alongside those criticisms, I also didn't speak up because I didn't think it was my place to as a teacher. 
","In my next role, I hope to be in a position where I am expected to have great influence over the staff culture; and I plan on creating a collaborative environment where everyone has a keen awareness of our school's goal and metrics, a clear understanding of their individual strategy to achieve the goal, and the reassurance that their ability to suggest new approaches, grounded in the spirit of what is best for students, is always welcome. 

If I'm not in a position with this expectation, I think I would have to push myself to my own learning edge and share my ideas instead of hampering them down with the belief that it isn't a part of my role. ",PreK-12 education,,School/district administrator,,,,,,,,,,,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Moderately valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Moderately valuable,Extremely valuable,Quite valuable,,,Moderately valuable,Not at all difficult,"It was extremely enjoyable reflecting upon myself as a learner. It helped remind me of why I am here, and that gave me greater motivation and excitement about the year ahead. ",Extremely well,"I liked the questions because they had me think about the development of my background and goals over a broad span of time. Naming people who have inspired me in education was something I haven't done in awhile. I also liked the dropdown list because it made it easy for me to prioritize from the choices. ",no,"Right now I'm not really sure what all of this information is driving toward in the context of the four sections. I think I'll gain a greater understanding as I continue and have more valuable suggestions for improvement then. But from a personal growth perspective, I quite enjoyed this section as is for allowing me to reconnect to my personal background and goals and refuel the flame for my time here. ","One of the most powerful learning experiences for me was going on a service-learning trip to Choluteca, Honduras. This was a week-long trip over spring break where we helped the community build a church and build a well so that a family can have a long-lasting supply to water. It was a tremendous immersive experience where I got to practice Spanish but also learn through hands-on approaches about urban planning and the effects of poverty. ","I wanted to go outside of the country in a service capacity and had heard great things about this program. ",Our group leader had us meet a semester beforehand on a weekly basis where we prepared for the trip through group learning and relationship building.,"Completing the well while we were there was extremely important to me. We got to know the family we were building the well for. We also had time scheduled to interact with the community, and that was motivating for me because I heard their stories about how they view American politics as well as their own country's.

We also got to hear updates from those who returned the following year. ","It was representative of how I prefer to learn by having a team-learning aspect, providing me with lots of preparation beforehand, and not involving a high-stakes atmosphere. ","I prefer to have a clear metric to refer back to as a means of measuring progress. We had this in a sense with physically seeing the progress of our well and church construction, but I didn't have this more formal metric for my individual growth in this same way. ",Slightly difficult,"I was hesitant to use the example that I did because it wasn't for a class but rather an extracurricular activity, but it was also the most meaningful learning experience I've been on so I decided to use it. ",Slightly well,"The questions gave me the opportunity to think about my learning preferences through the context of that single experience and to access the knowledge and beliefs I already have about myself as a learner. They didn't expose me to new ways of viewing or understanding my learning preferences. ",No.,"Provide more choices, like a drop down menu, of different learning preferences and allow the participant to comment upon these choices with the extent they use that preference, while also giving room for the participant to add any that aren't on the list. Then you could prompt the participant to explain how he/she used those preferences or was pushed to use different ones through the chosen learning experience. Perhaps there's a correlation between most meaningful learning experiences and the extent to which that experience pushes one outside of their learning preferences. ",Extremely accurate,"people's interests and styles are a product of their current extrinsic and intrinsic factors which change as one ages. ",,,Not at all accurate,,,"Human biology pales in comparison to one's conviction to accomplish a goal, and your goals and values are created by your cultural uprbringing. ",Not at all accurate,,,"Intelligence is not fixed. We lose and grow brain cells on a daily basis. As you practice a skill, your body neurologically shifts to enhance ability in that area (e.g., taxi drivers growing stronger hippocampus which is used for a sense of direction). This is not fixed at birth nor when one 'matures' at adulthood. ",Not at all accurate,,,"People have different inclinations toward different sets of tasks, and biology plays a role in that, such as people born tall having a biological advantage in making slam dunks in basketball - or perhaps someone is born with a pension for singing which others find appealing to listen to. Biology sets up parameters, but they are not impregnable for those born without them. By the same token, how one uses their time to hone certain skills plays a bigger role in the proficiency of that task. This, not 'talent' is what results in high success. ",Extremely accurate,"Another key goal should be to create collaborative learners. All students should have fluency in both styles of learning. ",,,Moderately accurate,,,"A learner cannot learn if they're not willing to, so in that sense they are ultimately responsible. However, even willing learners are not able to learn the things they don't know they don't know - nor can they be expected to independently understand the best practices for unfamiliar knowledge and skills. It is the teacher's responsibility to provide guidance in these areas. ",Extremely accurate,"People stopped believing this when we forced students to do this in contrived high-stakes situations. ",,,Not at all accurate,,,"External rewards can be just as if not more desirable than a personal motivation to learn, such as being paid a lot of money to learn something. ",Moderately accurate,,,"I know many learners who are able to tell how they learn best and are great advocates for learning in those methods, but I also see learners who fall into learning in ways that they know - ways that are comfortable - at the expense of heightening their learning. ",Moderately accurate,,,"In broad strokes, this statement generally holds. It's also a bit of a tautology since thinking deeply about facts builds mastery of facts. To an extent, it also depends on the concept being considered, like creating electricity versus defining ""love."" ",Slightly accurate,,,"I believe stress and anxiety do more to discourage learning than to encourage it, in general. However, there are limited examples of when they provide the proper incentive to learn when nothing else was working, such as finally causing a procrastinator to get started. ",Extremely accurate,"I believe we are all born with unique and boundless potential. I believe that potential can be nurtured and expanded through collaborative learning. Therefore, to bring about a world flourishing with the greatest parts of each of us, I commit to this approach in education. ",,,Moderately accurate,,,"Again, it depends on what the end goal is. If you're just trying to gain a DOK 1 level of understanding, it is probably most expedient to do so through your preferred learning style. However, relying too heavily on a single learning style causes dependency and a fixed mindset that you're only good at or can only receive learning in a certain way. There are times where one can only learn something new by learning it through a different style (like discussing v doing a concept). ",Not at all accurate,,,"I believe this puts the carriage before the horse and limits our society's future standard of living. When we teach our students to gain fluency in the jobs we expect them to have, the best they can do is fulfill those expectations. We leave no room for innovation, discovery, breakthroughs, or the like. Furthermore, in this model students must learn to show us themselves through the forums we've constructed for them which runs the risk of being different, less authentic, and less effective for the student than what they would have selected outside of constraint. ",Moderately accurate,,,"I believe giving students choice in how they demonstrate their mastery should be highly encouraged. But there are times when I need to see your ability to perform a specific skill with specific constraints (for example, draw and label a supply and demand graph by hand). In these cases, I'm not sure how much choice is left for you as the student. But, I believe we take this too far in education, for example, oftentimes in math we require to see a certain algorithm for solving a problem and call other approaches incorrect. ",Extremely accurate,"Even in educational experiences that are focused on discovery, reflection, or celebration and have no expectation of an end result or rubric for evaluating the learning, the high expectations of each learner committing their fullness to the learning should never be compromised. ",,,Not at all accurate,,,"Positive learning environments are generally better for learning, but critical and constructive feedback has its place in the learning process right alongside positive encouragement. ",Extremely accurate,"You can't learn new things if you don't risk new approaches. ",,,Not at all accurate,,,"Useful for whom? Many times, a student prefers a teacher's feedback to a students because it is more thorough and carries years of more experience with it. Many teachers prefer their own evaluation methods for measuring their efficacy. But peer-to-peer evaluation and feedback is beneficial for both the giver and receiver and forces them to view their own work in a different way. ",Moderately accurate,,,"Relevance is extremely important. Students have a hard time staying engaged if they don't see the WHY behind their learning. With that being said, some of the best inventions, like chocolate chip cookies, donut holes, and sticky notes, were accidents - you never know when, where, or how your next breakthrough will come about - so it's important to instill in students a willingness to play and explore with their learning outside of those parameters for its own sake. ",Extremely accurate,Such an effective teaching strategy,,,Moderately accurate,,,"This is generally true for getting students to feel mastery in the end-context they will employ the learning. But using different modalities will allow them to experience the learning in different ways, which has its value, as well. Also, constraints such as materials, class size, and the ability of technology to provide access to the learning for all students are additional factors that must be considered. ",Moderately accurate,,,"It depends on what the disagreement is. ",Not at all accurate,,,depends on the learner and the skill being taught,Not at all accurate,,,"depends on the learners and what is being learned, sometimes it is most helpful to have a heterogenous group, sometimes it is most helpful to have a homogenous group","I have really strong beliefs and values.

I first became involved in education because it is satisfying to help students gain confidence and understanding of topics, and each student is like a puzzle-- you can find out how to motivate and communicate with students individually. I also enjoy teaching because depending upon the topic, students are actually learning ways in which they will process (and later, express) their world views through language, questioning, observing, etc.","I started tutoring alongside working in a research lab, so my primary interest or goal was to establish personal connection and mentorship of women in the sciences. After a short switch of my career plan, I fell into education more concretely as something I had always loved and been good at, but never considered as a full-time profession (I never wanted to be a classroom teacher, and much prefer individualized education). I began tutoring full-time in French and Biology, and began to see the similarities in understanding for two vastly different subjects: the importance of application and ""outside of curriculum"" topics, of constantly prompting recall and looping old topics into new ones, and how structured a session needed to be for learning. My interest shifted to how material is presented, how it is tested, and how students are motivated. I have continued with these interests more concretely in the past two years.","My PI in the research lab I worked in (initially as an undergrad, then continuing after graduation) influenced me the most. She had a PhD from MIT in Genetics, worked with some of the big names in C.elegans molecular genetics research, and then chose to work in a university focused on teaching, not research. She saw something in me through my interactions with students in the lab, and pushed me into tutoring and mentorship. She stimulated my natural curiosity in research, applied to people (instead of worms :) She also helped to nudge me towards the path that feels natural (teaching), rather than the path that is celebrated (in her case, research; in mine, med school). In many ways, she prompted me to start from the bottom-- student by student, taking whatever came my way, and then provided a space for reflection on patterns I would see within them. She also mentored me, and has been mentoring me, for the past 9 years, so her investment in the personal, holistic success of her students has created a value that I have cultivated in my own educational practices.","How much we're learning about it: how much data is too much data? What data is relevant? What is the social construct of education, and how much of it is necessary in the modern era? I suppose I find a lot exciting about education, but I get most excited about the future: changing the status quo of how students are taught.","The politics of it, and that creating (convincing and funding) change seems to be so much further behind what we know we're capable of. ","Changing how we think about learning, and how there's so much that happens outside of school. Targeting tutoring and the test prep process are natural fits for this, because the in-between space of the after school time is seen as a place for educational opportunity, but also ""not school"". Many parents and students are more open to change when interacting with educators in this sphere, and I believe that change starts here before it can move into schools on a broader scale.",Corporation,,,,,,,,,,Educational media or technology design/development/production,,,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Quite valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Quite valuable,Moderately valuable,Moderately valuable,Extremely valuable,Quite valuable,Quite valuable,,,Moderately valuable,Moderately difficult,"It was most difficult to figure out what I want to do with my degree after HGSE, because there are a variety of different things that I know I could do, and that I could combine into a role.",Moderately well,"I answered reflective questions that didn't necessarily dive into my history as an educator (though understood it as a prerequisite for the way I answered questions) but I realized that I answered all questions through my perspective as an educator, not as a student, and I think both could be applicable. ","My goals have changed over the past year (and are still changing!), but this is a snapshot of the most recent view.","It is not very clear to me what the purpose of this section is, beyond prompting my own reflection. ","In my English class during my sophomore year of high school, my teacher was very passionate about linguistics and vocabulary, and made us memorize about 50 latin root words, as it would expand our vocabularies and help us on the SAT. I have specific memories of drilling down on my flashcards, needing to put each root into a word used in a sentence. I have always enjoyed vocabulary and language (and also majored in French) but especially as I became a biology major in college, the need for understanding and applying Latin roots and understanding more textured meaning through the etymology of words. 

The specific practice wasn't even a direct interaction between me and my teacher, but it was an extraordinarily well-created and well-positioned lesson that was outside the school curriculum and helped me so much. It gave me an appreciation for all language (not just ""foreign"" language), and it has changed the way I've taught. In teaching both Biology and French, I do emphasize the words themselves and applicability to understanding English better.","While I didn't have a choice (it was part of a classroom lesson), I did take the Honors Level English class where this experience took place, because teachers tended to better indulge students' curiosity and push students more in those classes.","My teacher gave us reasons to care: better reading comprehension, applicability to the SAT the following year (and the soph PSAT we were also about to take). She showed investment in our growth beyond state standards or understanding life lessons from book plots. Looking back, I'm also able to see how much she scaffolded the learning process for us: she had us make flashcards, use the roots in vocabulary words we chose, and then use those vocabulary words in a sentence; we were tested on that week's roots as well as a selection of roots we'd previously been tested on, so she stimulated ongoing recall. ","I was perhaps more intrinsically motivated than others because I absolutely love language, but she was a friendly but tough teacher; I was motivated to do well in her class, and the fact that she was doing something that wasn't the standard ""review the book and write an essay"" type of English class that I had grown bored with helped me to double down in different types of activities.

That's where i felt a wide gap between theory and practical application. This thought made me question education system as a whole in India ( where we cram theories to reproduce them in exams). 
It was also the time I was volunteering with Teach for India and it made all the sense to do things so that future generation in India doesn't have to suffer through the education systems that we were going through. Teach for India was doing some ground work with  public schools and at that point, it seemed completely right to start with  gaining grass root level experience in field of education. 
Secondly, while growing up as a girl in India, I had to face a lot of challenges which was making me lose my authenticity as an individual. I have to do things the way society liked it be done, I have to suppress myself to keep people around me happy, these activities kept piling up and gradually making me dig deeper into subjects like "" gender and education"". 
","I think my Interest and goals have been constant so far, however my way of approaching and looking at things might have changed and this is mostly because of the varied perspectives that I get to deal with. ","In 12th grade, I was very close to giving up on one of the many courses (that had always let me down). It was then that my father’s friend introduced me to a teacher, who was ready to take up the challenge for the remaining 8 months till I appeared for the national level exam. 12th grade National Board exam is known for the highest-order competency that any student in India takes up before entering into university life.

I can clearly recall how the tutor spent his evenings and midnights unselfishly teaching me to unlearn that I had learned since primary grades and then re-learn Mathematics using alternative pedagogy to the point that I was the highest scorer in my region that year. I had scored 99/100 that year. It was same Aarushi who once struggled to even have a 40% on a Mathematics exam. Since then ‘education sector’ has become very close to me. And that day I promised myself that I want to empower young children with quality education, especially the marginalized young girls who barely have people to invest in what they believe. I want to invest in them the same way my father and my teacher invested in my education: with courage, tenacity and unrelenting optimism.","How education has so much power to give freedom/ to give individuals different choices to make/ to give them their rights and above all give an individual voice. 
That's why I care so much about education, because in my country, i still feel so many people don't have luxury to be free, to make their own choices, to be aware of their rights and to voice out their opinion and only education can help them to do so. 
","I think in the space of education, the most difficult job would be to work on changing the mindset of people. There really has to be a revolution if you have to convince people in the poorest part of the world ""why we consider education as a long term investment?"" 

Secondly, in space of education it is very critical to understand that education doesn't exist in isolation, it is at intersection of variety of other sectors such as healthcare, private, urban planning, arts etc. ","I am at Harvard (HGSE) to really learn about how to work on ""changing mindset"" of people.

I struggled with what industry to go into after leaving science research and ultimately decided that rather than trying to find a job that could accommodate my interest/goals for a career, I would make a list of things I hoped to find in a future career and seek out a field that would naturally fit those goals. Psychology and education were the results of that process, and while I haven't written off psychology, education seems comfortable and natural for me. I love working with people, supporting others, and, as the daughter of two educators, I've been raised to understand how invaluable a good education is. I appreciate being involved in work that helps others gain access to education.","I feel like I'm still just entering the industry, so this is a hard question for me to answer. I've worked mainly in college admissions, but I've yet to work full-time in a position for more than a few months, which has made it hard to settle into a position and have goals that change. I guess I realized that going to a graduate program dedicated to education would give me some leverage in the education job market and would also potentially help narrow my interest in the greater education field. My target age group for education has remained the same (late high school - early college age), but the exact area I'd like to work in is still evolving.","My mother is my greatest influence when it comes to education. She was a first-generation college graduate and immigrant to the U.S. who navigated her own college process and ultimately attended some amazing schools (including HGSE!). As a single mother, she pursued a doctoral degree in education, and, despite needing to take some time off, ultimately earned her Ed. D. when I was 11. Having watched her as an educator at my own high school, I've seen the impact she has on students. Her dedication to furthering her own education and the tangible impact she's had on innumerable students, both at high schools and colleges around the country, has helped me understand the power a true educator can have. She inspires me to continue my own education, but her work in education has also helped me seen how gratifying and life-changing work as an educator can be.","'--working with people at pivotal life stages

I can attest that only about 30 percent of indigenous children in my hometown have access to education.  Nationally, my ultimate ambition is to either follow in the footsteps of my father and become a university president or enter the Philippine government and work for the Commission on Higher Education.  I would use my position to fight for the basic educational rights of indigenous and other disadvantaged groups in the Philippines and would seek to create a mixture of affordable learning programs.  My regional goal is to build upon my scholarship program that I launched with an English language school in Bangkok, Thailand two years ago.  I seek to expand my program so that students in all the ASEAN Member Countries can apply.","In the past, I focused a lot on higher education systems.  However, I've now become more interested in helping younger students, particularly those with little to no access to quality education.  In particular, I see that all my interests and goals in education have shifted to specifically helping people in Southeast Asia.  I have chosen to focus on this region because, after visiting countries in Southeast Asia and living in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines for a total of six years, I have come to the conclusion that Southeast Asia is my true home.","My father is currently a university president in the Philippines.  He also used to work for the California State University system when my family still resided in the United States.  When he became the president of Woodbury University in Burbank, California, he also became the first Filipino to become president of a US university after a nationwide competitive search.  His determination, genuine passion, and vision as an educator has always been an inspiration to me while growing up.  My father instilled in me my commitment to diversity and to creating quality programs for disadvantaged groups.  Because of him, I aim to return back to the Philippines and either follow his footsteps as a university president or work for the Commission on Higher Education.","I admire the potential that educators have to instill essential values, skills, knowledge, and tools in learners.  The learners will then use what they have learned from school to pursue their dreams.  It's exciting to work in the field of education because education itself is a source of empowerment.","As an educator, I've experienced and witnessed this lack of respect for educators.  I feel that many people, including students, don't realize the hard work that educators put into their job.  For example, when I was a college lecturer, some of my students would not do their homework, they would talk and be loud during class, or I would catch them doing other work in my class.  I often stayed up until 2:00AM preparing their lesson packets (in handwritten Arabic) and grading their work.  It is a tedious job, but I love it; I just wish that students would appreciate more what teachers do for them.","I don't know if there is anything that I can do to make students appreciate their educators more, as that is up to the students' own volition and power.  However, I was told that I need to be more strict.  I often made my lessons enjoyable by incorporating language games and interesting units on culture; I wanted my students to relate to and be interested in my lessons.  I am thinking, though, that perhaps they felt too comfortable and thus, felt that it was okay to be loud and not pay too much attention in my class.  I think I should be a little more strict the next time I teach.",Government,,,,,,Policy analyst,,,,,,,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,Not very valuable,Extremely valuable,Extremely valuable,,,Not very valuable,Slightly difficult,"The last part was a bit difficult for me to answer, which is why I only rated the particular components either ""extremely valuable"" or ""not valuable at all"" -- no rating in between.",Extremely well,"I feel a bit lost in my life right now and have many different career paths and options in mind.

I went there with a group of women as a field trip for our organization; there were about forty of us.  The exhibit featured 30 large mural paintings depicting Philippine history starting all the way from prehistoric times. My favorite mural at the exhibit was ""Women Empowerment in the Philippines"" by Dr. Grace Alfonso.  Seeing this mural was especially powerful and meaningful to me.  The artist painted several Filipina heroes in her work, such as Gabriela Silang and the women freedom fighters during martial law.  It was amazing to observe how Dr. Alfonso artistically included names of women's organizations along the bottom of her mural, as well.  I clearly remember this experience because it enabled me to learn more about my Filipino culture and prominent Filipinas throughout history.  I learned about topics that are not often included in history lessons or textbooks in US curricula.",Our visit to the art exhibit was a field trip for a women's organization that I was a part of when I lived in the Philippines.,"Our two leaders and facilitators -- the head people of the organization -- did not play a central role to the experience.

Instead of seeing them as our ""leaders"" during that experience, I saw them as people equal to my peers and me during that time.  We all sought to learn about our Filipino history, and we all -- including the leaders and facilitators -- realized that we had a lot to learn.

We were still able to interpret the artworks in our own, individual ways.  What made my learning experience different was that we got to share our viewpoints to our team members for each artwork we observed.  What I did not like, however, was skipping some works of art just because my team members did not want to see them, or spending little time at certain artworks just because my team members thought we were ""done looking.""  I would rather learn, observe, and go at my own pace.

My parents are both educators and I grew up constantly talking about my own education and schooling at large. As the youngest child of my family, with two older brothers, I was always provided the opportunity to share out about my day. My brothers, older (and more stubborn in their teenage years) would grunt out an answer to my parents about their day, so when it became my turn, there was also enough food on the table that I could tell every single detail before anyones plate was finished. I'd recount who raised their hand in what class, why I thought student X was mad at student Y, why I didn't enjoy the unit on butterflies etc. With education, I felt like there was always something to improve and talk about. I still feel that way, 20 years later. ","My interests and goals are constantly adapting to my own context. As a frequent traveler, I really began my passion for education with the importance of international education and travel. I wanted ( and still want)  to ensure that every student has an opportunity to study/live abroad. This drive was specifically pertinent when I was abroad. From Buenos Aires, to New Zealand, to Colombia, I felt that my role in education was to find ways to promote study and travel abroad, cultural exchange, and cultural immersion.  While I still value this to be true, and would still love to work in such a way that I am given the opportunity to travel to these places I love, my past year has altered where I see myself right now.  I worked in an education nonprofit, and became fascinated with the gap between community organizations and the districts they operate within. I started to question the ""point"" of these education nonprofits that seem to dot our education landscape every which-way.  I wonder how they improve a student population at a macro level (if at all), and if not, how can we work together as a district, schools, and community organizations to ensure every student has support not just the ones involved in an after-school center. ","Without a doubt my parents are my biggest influences. They are both so passionate about their work that it inspires me to consistently challenge myself to take risks and go after what I want. My dad instilled in me the importance of great teaching, and that great teaching is often not you at the center, but rather the facilitator. He also gave me a love of reading and research. Without him, I would not be where I am today. My mom is a go-getter and when she wants something she goes after it. When she's challenged by a decision, or unhappy about a students/family's behavior she works her butt off until it's resolved. I believe I have that within myself because of her and I hold it deep down in my core. Without the two of them, I would not be as passionate and determined to help improve our urban public education system. ","I truly believe education is the biggest change agent in our society. Without education, we would not be able to understand our history, our current state, or our future. Education provides us the tools and understanding to better improve our society and I find that to be the most exciting. We not only learn content and skill, but perhaps more importantly, the ability to interact and collaborate with people who are different than you and may hold different beliefs and values. Without education, this intersectionality would never occur. ","I find the most difficult thing about education are the rooted inequities in the system itself. Education remains the biggest equalizer and the biggest divider. ","I am determined to fight the fight for public education in this country and I think my fight and those among me are just beginning. I want to work hard to ensure that our education system works for the most needy individuals in our country. I believe the first question we should be asking ourselves when it comes to changes for our country is ""does this help the people who need it the most?"" I think in order to affect these changes, we need to put money where our mouths are. Money can be a catalyst for change and in our society we can be very stubborn where we put our  money. As a capitalist society, we often put money where we see money return (i.e. the banks), but I believe if we put money in the schools, we'll see much more success for our most needy, which will in the end become a greater equalizer for our country and we'll live with much less inequity. That's my hope at least and I am willing to fight for it. ",Other (please specify):,"I'd like to work at the intersection of schools, districts, and potentially government.

I also think it would be nice to have more flexibility (or even specificity) in the multiple choice answer of where you want to work post HGSE. ",See above,"I find my middle school years to be the most memorable in someway. Although they can be remembered as somewhat traumatic in terms of development, social drama, and difficult experiences in school, I truly believe they helped me become the learner I am today. I attended K-8 schools, and during my middle school years, the administration completely changed. We went from a highly progressive, hippy-centric, family-loving neighborhood school, to a much more sharp around the edges type of place and with that came new types of teachers and curricula. As a reaction, my classmates and I acted out (a lot). I imagine it was particularly traumatizing for our teachers, but as a class, it bonded us forever. However, all of the above information is crucial to understand the specific learning situation I am about to describe. My 7th grade ELA/Humanities teacher taught us about restorative justice, a new hot-topic in the early 2000s and my class loved it. Especially because it felt like our classmates were suspended every other day for some minor and some major actions. This project on restorative justice was a main project of our year and is memorable because I was partnered with the labelled ""misbehaved"" student in our class. However, because we both were so fascinated in the topic, and saw how it related to our lives, we worked seamlessly together. We presented to students, parents, staff, and administration the importance in engaging in restorative justice practices and I think everybody walked away not only understanding the importance of restorative justice, but how it effected our every day life in school, and the opportunity to see two very different students working together for the same end goal. ","It was an assignment for school and I made sure to complete it to the best of my ability. ","The teacher was imperative to that story because of the curriculum she implemented. I'm unsure if it came from her personally or the school itself, but the ability to teach 7th graders the importance of restorative justice is one I quite obviously will never forget. I was always a student who got her work done, and although it frustrated me, this teacher always paired me with students who needed a little extra focus or push. Even though I wanted to be paired with my best friends, I still made sure to get the work done with the partner I was assigned. I think because she partnered me with the more challenging students, it forced me to work harder, and I then got more out of it. ","I think the ability to learn about a concept that actually affected me and others was incredibly motivating. Restorative justice is still something I talk a lot when it comes to schools and I trace it back to my 7th grade days when my classmates were suspended left and right.

No test or exam was going to help me better understand this new concept, but rather the ability to explain to others and those others who were respected adults (parents, staff, teachers, admin). The opportunity to give two students a chance to teach adults something changed the narrative and excited us to be the storytellers. ","In many ways this project was my ideal learning style. I was learning a new concept, but engaged in the new material and saw how it affected me and my classmates everyday.  I worked with another individual, who had a very different learning style and background and we were able to collaborate to create our own project.I also was able take my new learning and present it in my own style. We created posters and visual representations and then presented to a wide-array of adults who had never heard of the concept of restorative justice before.  We also had the opportunity to hear our classmates present on their topics they researched. Then after our presentation, we reflected upon our own learning and that's when it really marinated for me.

I have strong feelings about social justice issues. But I am not a warrior at heart. My skills are in nurturing, empathy, care-taking. Education is a way I can try to shape the world for the better with the skills I do have--to fight the good fight, without *fighting* the good fight.

I was an intern for an arts organization that did educational programming. I had a coworker who worked both an artist (storyteller) and a teacher. And her storytelling/performance work made her a BETTER educator, it informed the way that she taught. Working as an educator connected her work as a performer to a community. That model of interconnected teaching/education really stuck with me.

I worked with a colleague who approached teaching like improv--his belief was that you should always say ""Yes , and"" to your students. His golden rule was that every student's ideas were ALWAYS good/right/correct in some way. And that your job as a teacher was to help find the way in which that idea/thought was right/strong and to help them build on it. I've never forgotten that, that you should always approach students with the deep belief that they are awesome. Because they are.

However, I majored in finance and then started working for a consulting firm. The team I was allocated was not completely focused on finance so I got to work on a lot of different sectors. While working with some of the social sector clients there, I realized that I can truly have a real impact on people by working in the social sector; something I would never be able to do as a consultant. I started exploring this area more, and I came across Teach for India fellowship, which I thought was a great way to get started in the education section and learn about the grassroot realities of this sector in India.

While I was mostly focused on the short-term outcomes, limited horizon of my actions, she molded me to think more about the bigger picture. For instance, while I knew that I loved working on literacy development and that would be something I would want to pursue in the long run, she pushed me to think more about why ""literacy"" in education? What is the larger purpose that it serves? Through this constant inquiry, I was able to articulate for myself that I wanted to work in literacy development to enable powerful exchange of ideas between people, with a limited scope for miscommunication due to language barriers. ","The fact that I get to impact ""real lives"" and I can myself see the impact of my teaching in various small or big ways. Also that there is a lot of room for new and powerful ideas.

","The questions on preferred career and sector choice could have 2-3 different options than just one, as for someone like me, who's still a beginner to this sector, its difficult to choose just one area right now. I'm open to trying out different fields.","When I think about a learning situation, I think about an experience or a conversation that led to a learning, more than a formal learning environment. The most powerful of these has been the time I spent in the classroom with my students at Teach for India. Every moment spent teaching those kids has been a powerful learning opportunity for me. I learnt not just about a subject matter I was teaching, but also about the behavioral aspects of students, as well as facts about my own personality. ","The experience was part of the Teach for India fellowship, so I'll explain why I did the fellowship. Aside from the act that I wanted to learn more about the education sector in India, it was also because I wanted to challenge myself. Before Teach for India (TFI), I had always followed the conventional path in life; choosing to do what society expected me to do, never thinking about what I really wanted. When I came across TFI, I realized that this is what I've always wanted to do, but never had the courage to do it. Taking up this opportunity meant challenging myself to:
- give up a high paying job, 
- work in slums, away from the glamour of a corporate life
- go against my parents' and society's expectations from me.

And with these challenges, I also knew that I would have an incredible opportunity to learn, which is what my eyes were set on. ","In this case, I myself was the teacher. But what made the entire TFI experience powerful was how after every experience, we had a debrief and reflection with our manager to really understand our feelings and thoughts about the experience. So while I learnt at every single moment in the classroom, this was followed, once or twice a month, by reflection sessions with my manager, which helped me make sense of my learning. ","'- Appreciation and love from students, as well as my manager when I did a good job

Art classes kept me in school as a teenager. I remember asking one of my high school art teachers how she got her job. It seemed like a dream to get to make things and share skills with people. I thought I would get a teaching degree as a 'backup' to art-making. ","After my first year as a teaching stagiere I found myself somewhat obsessed with understanding how and why kids learn. Since then I have been using a creative and arts-integrated approach to teaching. The more I information I had about motivation and the brain the more curious I got about what holds kids back. As the majority of my work experience has been in struggling urban schools, I have turned to look at factors of success associated with poverty and discrimination. ","I make a real effort to learn from every person that I come across, especially educators with some spark of magic that is new to me. There are so many names I could put here. I think the first, and maybe most memorable was a high school English teacher I had named Mrs. Hetherington. I remember her making a real effort to know us individually. She had High expectations but did not expect us all to respond or process material in the same way. She often left assignments open ended and allowed us to determine how we would show her our learning. The second person I will name here is Greg Shamie. Greg is the Director of Staff Development for my former employer–The Leadership Program. He is hands down the most engaging speaker/facilitator I have ever met. His humour and passion are infectious. These two incredible educators have been key in shaping how I walk into a room of learners. From their examples I take a deep understanding of the importance of engagement, relationships and making people feel.","Some of the most memorable and joyful experiences I have had in my life have taken place in schools. I have seen incredible teachers create space for their students that glitter with possibility. I see so many people in education going all-in to make schools learning equitable and to create meaningful change. I think education can breathe life into some of the dingiest corners of our society. ","I think especially in the US, there are so many people pulling in so many different directions that sometimes we are cancelling each other out. I think researchers can do a better job at messaging and spreading 'what works' to the people on the ground. My number one concern is the lack of emphasis we put on mental health and emotional well-being in schools. Especially in neighbourhoods where students experience traumatic and chronically stressful situations at an early age, allocating resources to address emotional needs are paramount to academic success. 
","I plan to continue to work towards building teacher training and professional development for school staff that will make people aware of how trauma and toxic stress affect little brains and bodies. In conjunction, I will look to identify what interventions and school culture policies can help students heal and access the tools they need to learn.

I moved to a new high school after 8th grade and was placed in lower level math and science classes by the guidance counselor. I quickly learned these classes were far too easy for me and learned to navigate the high school administrative system in order to enter higher level classes that were a better match to my ability. This experience haunted me as I can continued through graduate school and later took the math portion of the GRE. I began working in higher education and quickly realized that once I learned how a system worked, I enjoyed helping others to understand and navigate these systems. I didn't really know that higher education was the best field for me until I worked in the field and realized that I could help others in this way.","My main goal is still to help others navigate systems of education and gain access to education, but as I have gained more experience in the field of education, specifically higher education, I have begun to suss out exactly how I wanted to contribute to the field of education. I still enjoy helping prospective students learn to navigate the system of education through my work in admissions, but I have gained experience with pipeline programs and other ways to reach applicants that I had no idea existed before. I have also learned the power of data and using this power to guide decision making and make changes in higher education. Although my goal remains the same, the way I reach this goal has evolved over time.","The individuals I am thinking of have influenced my goals and values in different ways. One main motivation is to further my education through graduate studies, which is what one influencer has helped me to realize will help my goals. Another influencer has helped me to learn about others way impact access to education and expand the ways in which I think about how I can impact the field.","The main thing that comes to mind is the broad range of ways that education can be impactful in an individual's life. Education can make such a different in the lives of many people and can affect people in so many different ways. For example, my undergraduate studies changed me at my core level and completely reshaped the way I viewed the world. Additionally, education itself is so broad, it can cover so many different areas. For instance, education isn't just about going to school, but also forming a community and expanding your mind. I think that this excites me about education. I'm always learning new things and seeing different ways in which people view education.","The people that education fails. Unfortunately, education is not equal in the US and many people miss out on a good education and don't get that life changing experience so many have. At a basic level, education can be the different between a minimum wage job and a job with a salary and benefits. At a broader level, education can shape the way one views the world including a person's values, political views, etc. Education is unequally distributed by race and socioeconomic status, to name two things. Additionally, although education seems to be a shared value for many in the US, we are unable to make sure that everyone in the country has access to a good education. It's extremely frustrating, especially since we live in such a wealthy country.","I continue to be frustrated by these challenges and although I'm not able to make a huge difference in my current role, I try to help as much as possible. I think being able to consider factors such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic circumstances in every single thing I do is one way in which I try to confront challenges. This could mean in the way I analyze data and the factors that I look at to encouraging events for underrepresented minorities and ensuring these events are successful and well run. I hope to continue to bring this attitude in my future roles and work and to make even more of an impact.

I was too scared to take the leap into being a fultime teacher as well as I was terrifying I would burn out and it would leave me in a place of total uncertainty as I never want to be disillusioned from this work. It was almost cowardly. As a way to understand this insecurity, I took a job with a non-profit that gave me direct in the classroom capacity once a week.

However being frustrated with the organization of the nonprofits I was a part of, I became increasingly interested in how nonprofits could improve their structure to be more effective. 

Ultimately the core of my interest in education stems for wanting to address structural inequalities to make society more just. ","Mike O'Leary! When he started working at Prep for Prep, I was a high school student just starting my required modules on leadership and ethics. He was dynamic, strange and gregarious- a white man who called all out and in to participate in a space of intellectual growth. When I began working at a literacy nonprofit and wanted to incorporate some leadership skills into my work with students there, I reached out to him to ask for advice. That started the growth of our professional and personal relationship as my mentor. He is quite the opposite from the students he serves  but his commitment to serving them in a well rounded way, by challenging them and making them truly dig into their beliefs really informs how I approach my work as an educator. ","Everything! The excitement of learning new things, the excitement of watching others learn new things, the growth you can see in a group or individual, the tension, and conflict that arises when confronted with an unfamiliar challenge, the people dedicated to this work!","The pay and by extension, the way our society treats educators- it feels aligned with our capitalistic and oppressive societal structure that wants to keep people away from achieving equality. The burn out rate is absurd and frustrating because of how we lose educators we need. I also find it difficult when educators don't have the same level of investment in the role. Unlike other sectors, it gets harder to manage that.","I am very concerned with ensuring that educators feel empowered and want to make it part of my study. I want to ensure that social-change systems are truly social change systems and make part of their own structure be conscious of how it could play into inequities. I want to listen to those doing the work and put their perspective always at the forefront rather than mine from the outside. I never want to be one of those people who get to the top and forget who is below them.

A part of me wanted to go way in depth but then a part of me looked at the freedom to slack off a little bit. I wish there was a word count minimum so that even if you chose to answer questions in a less narrative way, there was still a way to create an expectation of content. For me it made me realize how I have to give more into my learning as I ease back into school more AND how I have to hold myself to higher standards as I want to continue to learn throughout life. ",Moderately well,"The questions progressed well ","My goals are ever changing though the WHY is the same- to create a more just, diverse and equitable world through the lens of education. The profession question threw me off because I'm still working through how to see my next steps.","Add perhaps a second job section to allow people to express the different paths they might be thinking about.
